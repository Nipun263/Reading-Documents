Q:Can you make the constructor of a class static?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java, If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur. In general, static means class level.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How ot automate get and post request 

Ans we can store/manage the json data in 3 forms 
--json file 
--org.json librarg 
--pojo class 

using file , filereader , JSONTokener JSONObject you can call the data from json file 

Response res = given().ContentType(ContentType.JSON).body().when().Post("");

Using JSON File 

//////////////////////Extracting the Single Order ////////////////////////
		
		JSONObject object1 = new JSONObject(Res.asPrettyString());
		int size = object1.length();
		System.out.println("Size of Objects is " + size);

		System.out.println("Complete Data Extracted from response is "  + object1.toString());
		
		String Salary_Employee_FirstRecord = Res.jsonPath().getString("employee[0].salary");
		System.out.println("Gender from firstRecord of Employee  is " + Salary_Employee_FirstRecord );
		
		
		String contractFrom = Res.jsonPath().getString("contractors[0].contractFrom");
		System.out.println("Contract from firstRecord of Employee  is " + contractFrom );
		
		String companyHOCity = Res.jsonPath().getString("companyHOCity");
		System.out.println("Company HO City  from firstRecord of Employee  is " + companyHOCity );

Q:DataBase connectivity in selenium ?

Ans -
Selenium Webdriver is limited to Testing your applications using Browser. To use Selenium Webdriver for Database Verification you need to use the JDBC ("Java Database Connectivity").

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a SQL level API that allows you to execute SQL statements. 

DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl,username,password);

Q:Explain API testing and how can we achieve it?

Ans -->
Base + End point + parameter 

Query paramters -------------------->  when there is a question mark(?) this is query parameter 
Path parameter --------------------------> when there is a / -- this is query parameter 

See example 
Varible			IntialValue 					CurrentValue (yeh apne aap pick karega)
Base			http://localhost:3000			http://localhost:3000
EndPoint		APIBatch						APIBatch

Get address pehle tha ---http://localhost:3000/APIBatch
Now it became 			{{Base}}/{{EndPoint}}


Firstly it will check inside the env variables - if there will  be value then it will pick that valuse else it will look into global variables 

Whatever is same -- always keep it in global variables 
whatever is changed for all environments ---make it as environmental variable 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between Class and Structure?

Ans - A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a class combines the fields and methods(member function which defines actions) into a single unit.

A structure is a collection of variables of different data types under a single unit. It is almost similar to a class because both are user-defined data types and both hold a bunch of different data types.
===============================================================================================================================================
Difference between Stack and Heap memory?
In a stack, the allocation and de-allocation are automatically done by the compiler whereas in heap, it needs to be done by the programmer manually.

Handling of Heap frame is costlier than the handling of the stack frame.
Memory shortage problem is more likely to happen in stack whereas the main issue in heap memory is fragmentation.


Stack frame access is easier than the heap frame as the stack have a small region of memory and is cache-friendly, but in case of heap frames which are dispersed throughout the memory so it causes more cache misses.

Q:1) What is multithreading?
Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. Multithreading is used to obtain the multitasking. It consumes less memory and gives the fast and efficient performance. Its main advantages are:

Threads share the same address space.
The thread is lightweight.
The cost of communication between the processes is low.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:118. Can an Interface be defined in a Class?
Ans -
Yes, you can define an interface inside a class and it is known as a nested interface. You can't access a nested interface directly; you need to access (implement) the nested interface using the inner class or by using the name of the class holding this nested interface.

===============================================================================================================================================
1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.
===============================================================================================================================================
140.Can we re-throw an Exception in Java?

Ans -
When an exception is cached in a catch block, you can re-throw it using the throw keyword (which is used to throw the exception objects).

Ex1 - 
try {
   int result = (arr[a])/(arr[b]);
   System.out.println("Result of "+arr[a]+"/"+arr[b]+": "+result);
}
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
   throw e;
}


Ex 2 -
try {
   int result = (arr[a])/(arr[b]);
   System.out.println("Result of "+arr[a]+"/"+arr[b]+": "+result);
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
   throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
}

Question: How is Webdriver beneficial over Selenium Server?
Answer: Webdriver does not require the Selenium Server because it uses a completely different technology. It provides Selenium RC functionality, which provides backward compatibility to Selenium 1.0. Also, it makes a direct call to the various browsers for making automation. At the same time, in the case of Selenium RC, it requires the Selenium Server to input the Javascript into the browser.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Define Vector in collections ?

Ans - Vector implements a dynamic array that means it can grow or shrink as required. 
Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index
They are very similar to ArrayList but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy method that the collection framework does not contain.
It also maintains an insertion order like an ArrayList 


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector are all implementations of the List interface. Which of them is most efficient for adding and removing elements from the list? Explain your answer, including any other alternatives you may be aware of.

Ans 

Out Of the three, LinkedList is generally going to give you the best performance. Here’s why:

ArrayList and Vector each use an array to store the elements of the list. As a result, when an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly. Vector is synchronized, so if a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList rather than Vector.

LinkedList, on the other hand, is implemented using a doubly linked list. As a result, an inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed.

However, it is worth noting that if performance is that critical, it’s better to just use an array and manage it yourself, or use one of the high performance 3rd party packages such as Trove or HPPC.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you swap the values of two numeric variables without using any other variables?

Ams 
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:*****What is the difference between String s = "Test" and String s = new String("Test")? Which is better and why?

Ans -
In general, String s = "Test" is more efficient to use than String s = new String("Test").

In the case of String s = "Test", a String with the value “Test” will be created in the String pool. If another String with the same value is then created (e.g., String s2 = "Test"), it will reference this same object in the String pool.

However, if you use String s = new String("Test"), in addition to creating a String with the value “Test” in the String pool, that String object will then be passed to the constructor of the String Object (i.e., new String("Test")) and will create another String object (not in the String pool) with that value. Each such call will therefore create an additional String object (e.g., String s2 = new String("Test") would create an addition String object, rather than just reusing the same String object from the String pool).
===============================================================================================================================================
11. What is the difference between type keys and type commands?

Ans -TypeKeys() will trigger JavaScript events, while type() won’t. TypesKeys collects different value attributes using JavaScript. Whereas, the type commands imitate an actual user typing.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What is an exception test in Selenium?

Ans - An exception test is a test that looks forward to an exception to be thrown inside a test class. It anticipates the @Test annotation followed by the expected exception name. For example, @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class) is an exception test for missing elements in Selenium.

Note: Keep in mind the syntax, where the exception is suffixed with .class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How will you use Selenium to upload a file?

Ans - If the file is on the same machine or in a mapped network drive, it is really straightforward: We have to just type the ‘path’ of the file in the FileUpload control.

Example:

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
element = driver.find_element_by_id("fileUpload")
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")
===============================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you identify an object in Selenium?
Ans -We can use isElementPresent (string locator) to find an object in Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and, if found, returns a Boolean.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which is the only browser that supports Selenium IDE to be used?
Firefox
===============================================================================================================================================
----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object 
===============================================================================================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:can we use the same code in catch block ?
Only error prone code is within the try block and the handling of that error is written in the catch block..Catch block is use to handle run time exception ?
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is Java Case Sensitive?

Ans - Yes 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Why we use static keyword in import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*?

Q:Can we throw an exception manually?

If yes, how?Yes, we can throw an exception manually using throw keyword. Syntax for throwing an exception manually isthrow InstanceOfThrowableType

Throwing exceptions manually
You can throw a user defined exception or, a predefined exception explicitly using the throw keyword.

There are two types of exceptions user defined and predefined each exception is represented by a class and which inherits the Throwable class.

To throw an exception explicitly you need to instantiate the class of it and throw its object using the throw keyword.

public class ExceptionExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
      NullPointerException nullPointer = new NullPointerException();
      throw nullPointer;
   }
}


Whenever you throw an exception explicitly you need to make sure that the line with throw keyword is the last line of the program. This is because any code written after it is unreachable code and if you still have code snippets below this line a compile time error will be generated.



Example 2


class ThrowExcep
{
    static void fun()
    {
        try
        {
            throw new NullPointerException("demo");
        }
        catch(NullPointerException e)
        {
            System.out.println("Caught inside fun().");
            throw e; // rethrowing the exception
        }

Q: When to use  concat and when to use plus in strings ?


public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s = "Gfg";
        s = s.concat("! is the best.");
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.

-----
public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s1 = "Gfg";
        String s2 = "! is the best";
  
        String s3 = s1 + s2;
  
        System.out.println(s3);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.



---------->Number of arguments the concat() method and + operator takes: <------------------

concat() method takes only one argument of string and concat it with other string.

+ operator takes any number of arguments and concatenates all the strings.


public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String s = "Geeks", t = "for", g = "geeks";
  
        System.out.println(s + t + g);
        System.out.println(s.concat(t));
    }
}

Output :
Geeksforgeeks
Geeksfor


---------------<Performance<----------------------
concat() method is better than + operator because it creates a new object only when the string length is greater than zero(0) but + operator always a creates a new string irrespective of length of string.

Q:Difference in Automation testing/Tester and SDET (Software Design Engineer in test)
Automation Testing can be referred to role/designation as well as it is the term use to differentiate between Manual Testing and Automation Testing. You can say that I am in Automation Testing, I am Automation Tester, I am a Test Developer,Test Automation proffessional etc. But yes when it comes to the term SDET(Software Development/Design Engineer in Test) This refers to a role which has expertise in below aspects of Automation Testing (not mandatorily all but most of it):

Automation Framework Designing-Selenium, Cucumber, Siquili, AutoIT, RPM, Rest-Assured API, OK HTTP, etc

Coding/Scripting (Java,C#, Python, Pearl, Ruby etc)

CICD pipeline (continuous Integration Continuous Development/Delivery)- Jenkins, Maven,Bamboo etc. DevOps tools and practices -GitHub, Ansible, Docker etc.

Apart from all above, SDET must also be aware of QA practices, Like Agile, Waterfall, STLC SDLC, defect lifecycle, Diff Types of Testings, Testing situational dealings, Test Plan and artifacts etc.
==================================================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Ques.28. Explain the different types of specification based test design technique?
Ans. Specification based test design techniques are also referred to as blackbox testing. It involves testing based on the specification of the system under test without knowing its internal architecture. The different types of specification based test design or black box testing techniques are-

    Equivalence partitioning - Grouping test data into logical groups or equivalence classes with the assumpation that all the data items lying in the classes will     have same effect on the application.
    Boundary value analysis - Testing using the boundary values of the equivalence classes taken as the test input.
    Decision tables - Testing using decision tables showing application's behaviour based on different combination of input values.
    Cause-effect graph - Testing using graphical representation of input i.e. cause and output i.e. effect is used for test designing.
    State transition testing - Testing based on state machine model.
    Use case testing - Testing carried out using use cases.user action and system response.


Ques.34. What is use case testing?
Ans. A use case testing is a black box testing approach in which testing is carried out using use cases. A use case scenario is seen as interaction between the application and actors(users).



Ques.41). What are the different types of Integration testing?
Ans. The different type of integration testing are-

    Big bang Integration Testing - In big bang integration testing, testing starts only after all the modules are integrated.
    Top-down Integration Testing - In top down integration, testing/integration starts from top modules to lower level modules.
    Bottom-up Integration Testing - In bottom up integration, testing starts from lower level modules to higher level module up in the heirarchy.
    Hybrid Integration Testing - Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom up integration testing. In this approach, the integration         starts from middle layer and testing is carried out in both the direction

Q: What is Authentication / Autherization ?

Ans - 
Authentication / Authorization 

Authorization - user has rights or not 



for example 
ek hamari application hai ----aur ek outer application hai say Indigo ya british airlines --ab british airlines ya indogo ne apni API's expose ki hui hai so that koi bhe use kar sake , jaise hum (MMT ) hain we can also use the exposed api of indigo or british airlines 


Ab Britsh auirlines ya indogo ki api's hum directly use nahe kar sake , we should have the rights to consume it .


Types of Authentication ::

---- Basic authentication --------- username and password 
---- oAuth Authentication ----> you need to pass -----> Consumer Key , Consumer Secret ,Access Token ,Token Secret
---- Token Id / Bearer Token --- Ek API hit karke -> token id milegi --> you have to use it in API-Application ---here we need to pass the token in the postman_collection
---- oAuth2 ----> Only token need to be passed 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Authentication examples 


Always go to offcial document like jira api documentation 

Example of basic Authentication ::::

  .basic("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  .get("http://localhost:8080/spring-security-rest-basic-auth/api/foos/1")
  .then()
  .assertThat()
  .statusCode(HttpStatus.OK.value());
  
  
  
  Ex 2 : 
  
  given().auth()
  .oauth2(accessToken)
  .when()

Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?
Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): An XML-based method to expose web services.

REST (Representational State Transfer): Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the most popular way to represent a resource in REST?

REST uses different representations to define a resource like text, JSON, and XML.
XML and JSON are the most popular representations of resources.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which protocol is used by RESTful Web services?

RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between the client and the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
What are the core components of an HTTP request?
An HTTP request contains five key elements:

An action showing HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is the identifier for the resource on the server.
HTTP Version, which indicates HTTP version, for example-HTTP v1.1.
Request Header, which carries metadata (as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message. Metadata could be a client (or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of a message body format, cache settings, and so on.
Request Body, which indicates the message content or resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is there any difference between PUT and POST operations?

Q: Difference between PUT and Patch
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the upper limit for a payload to pass in the POST method?

Ans -So, theoretically, a user can pass unlimited data as the payload to POST method. But, if we consider a real use case, then sending POST with large payload will consume more bandwidth. It’ll take more time and present performance challenges to your server. Hence, a user should take action accordingly.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain what is REST and RESTFUL?

REST represents REpresentational State Transfer; it is a relatively new aspect of writing web API.

RESTFUL is referred for web services written by applying REST architectural concept are called RESTful services, it focuses on system resources and how state of resource should be transported over HTTP protocol to different clients written in different language. In RESTFUL web service HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE can be used to perform CRUD operations.

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

Q:*******Use of import static org.hamcrest?

Ans : Hamcrest is a widely used framework for unit testing in the Java world.

Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read. For this, it provides additional matcher classes which can be used in test for example written with JUnit. You can also define custom matcher implementations.

To use Hamcrest matchers in your test you use the assertThat statement followed by one or several matchers.

Whenever we want to assert something we use hancrest , for example 
	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));

   }
}}}

====================================================Added on 01-Nov -21 ========================================================================
Q:32. Can we add a duplicate in a set and map if yes why write one code?
Ans : 
If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key. HashMap is similar to HashTable, but it is unsynchronized. It allows to store the null keys as well, but there should be only one null key object and there can be any number of null values.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:34. Can we write only concrete methods in Abstract class?
Yes , In that case it will not be a abstarct class , it will be a normal class .

Q:Diff between URL and URI ?

URL -URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is often defined as a string of characters that is directed to an address. It is a very commonly used way to locate resources on the web. URL is a type of URI.

URI -URI is the superset of URL.

Q:What is Hybrid Framework?
Hybrid Driven Framework is a mix of both the Data-Driven and Keyword Driven frameworks.

In this case, the keywords as well as the test data, are externalized. Keywords are stored in a separate Java class file and test data can be maintained in a Properties file or an Excel file.

Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?
WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

Q:Api vs WebServices 

Ans : 
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Trobleshooting in API?

Ans 
Is the URL correct?
Is the API key valid? - Each user has a unique key.
Is the authorization header valid?
Are the request parameters valid?
Did the API call return the expected results?
Did the API call return the expected results with expected performance 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Auth vs autherization 

Ans 
Authentication is when an entity proves an identity. In other words, Authentication proves that you are who you say you are. This is like having a driver license which is given by a trusted authority that the requester, such as a police officer, can use as evidence that suggests you are in fact who you say you are.

Authorization is an entirely different concept and in simple terms, Authorization is when an entity proves a right to access. In other words, Authorization proves you have the right to make a request. Consider the following - You have a working key card that allows you to open only some doors in the work area, but not all of them.


In summary:
Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity
Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action

Q:How to check security in API's 

Ans: 
4 Quick Ways to Test if Your API is Secure

    1. Parameter tampering
    2. Injection
    3. Input Fuzzing
    4. Unhandled HTTP Methods
	
1. Parameter tampering

Parameter tampering is when an attacker changes the values in an API request. This type of attack takes advantage of hidden parameters used in API requests to pass “secure” information. For example, this could be used to change the purchase price of a product by changing the value assigned to the price or cost parameter. 
To test if parameter tampering is possible, you can examine any API related elements in your site or web app through the development console in your browser. If you change the value in your console, submit it with the included change, and the application accepts it, your API is not secure. 


2. Injection

An injection attack occurs when an attacker inserts hostile input into an API. A common example is SQL injection, where SQL queries or commands are submitted, in the hope that they will be run against the backend database.

Another common example is command injection, where an attacker inserts commands into a request or input. When processed, these commands are read by the receiving system as separate from the request, and are executed as standalone commands. 

Attackers can use these attacks for many malicious purposes, including gaining access to systems through privilege escalation, rebooting devices, or deleting data.

To test if your API is vulnerable to command injection, you can try submitting a request like the following:


3. Input Fuzzing

Input fuzzing is performed by providing random information to an API through automation until an unexpected effect occurs. Often, the application will crash. Other effects might include an error message indicating that an input was partially valid. 
When performing fuzz tests, the two most common inputs to target are numbers and strings. To test number inputs, you should try submitting numbers outside the expected range, such as negative numbers, very large numbers, or decimal numbers. To test strings you can send very large strings, or strings with unexpected unicode.

Fuzzing reveals an application’s vulnerability to being remotely crashed by an attacker. It is unlikely to reveal significant weaknesses that an attacker could exploit, but is stlil useful in testing the robustness of an application



4.Unhandled HTTP Methods
To test if unsecure or unintended methods are allowed, try sending requests with known but unused and arbitrary methods. If either gets a valid response rather than an error (such as 405 or 501) you need to block those methods.

Q:What is rest assured ?
Ans - It is java lib that helps to automate the rest api's .

It can be used for writing test cases and can be integrated with maven and extent reports .Also response can be verified using this , it is compactable with diff http verbs such as put,post,delete,patch and Get.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the static imports needed for rest assured automation 
Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why static imports , why we need and what will happen agar yeh na ho to

Ans : Static import karne se (jo hum imports mein static keyword use karte hain ) , uska advantage yeh hota ki aapk kisi bhe package se koi bhe method kisi aur pacjage mein bula sakte ho without even importing the package .

simply aise kar, jaise package 1 mein 2 methods hain method1 , method2 

aap ko yeh package 2 mein bulana hai to using static in the import ypou can directly do 

method1();
methpd2();

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to get the response time from response ?
Ans 
Res.gettime();
Res.gettimeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);
Res.time();
Res.timeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Form Authentication ?

Ans :
Using Form Authentication
Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.

When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information.

Normally, the form indicates the endpoint that it'll call with its action attribute, and each input field corresponds with a form parameter sent in the request.

If the login form is simple enough and follows these rules, then we can rely on REST Assured to figure out these values for us:

given().auth()
  .form("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
  
  
Example : 
baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/api";
given()
        .auth().form("admin", "admin", new FormAuthConfig("/authentication/", "j_username", "j_password"))
.when()
        .get("/formAuth")
        .then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200);

Q:How to handle stale element exception ?

Ans - keeping the code which is causign stale element exception in try block and in catch block identify same element & copy same code jo issue kar 
rha tha un catch block 

see example - bmwCheckBox was causing staleekenebt exception

	
public void StaleElementHandled() throws InterruptedException {
		
		WebElement bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
		bmwCheckBox.click();
		driver.navigate().refresh();
		
		//Jo bhe statement is causing stale element out that in try block . In Catch block -followed by identifying same 
		//element once again and again keeping same line in catch block
		
		
		try {
			
		    bmwCheckBox.click();
		
		}
		
		catch(Exception e) {
			bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
			bmwCheckBox.click();
			System.out.println("Exception handled is " +  e.getMessage());
		}

Q:8 Where to use hashmap & where hash table?

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.
HashMap- not synchronished , HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values ,HashMap is fast. HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.
HashTables - sychronised , slow , Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value. , Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
===============================================================================
Q:What is JSON ?

Ans : Understanding mein issue aye to refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfshV5n6ac
Java Script object notation - it takes the input in form of key:value pair and it starts with { or [ .{ for jsonObject and [ for jsonArray

JSON Schema : it is a schema / structural validation .Jo bhe response aa rha hai aapko , json schema is validating the expected data type and format .
jaise firstname , lastname a rha hai response mein to unki datatype string honi chaiye ---- to es case mein schema validator yhi confirm karega ki 
fields : firstname , lastname  have datatype string or not 


Steps :
1.Login to https://www.jsonschema.net/home
2.Paste your response here 
3.It will share the scheme with you 
4.Go to postman 
5.Under test tab 
6.Select tiny validator jaise aap status code ke liye karte ho 

Now paste this 



var schema = {
====== Paste ypur schema :: jo aapko yaha se mila hai  https://www.jsonschema.net/home  =============
}


var actualData = pm.response.json(); /////////////////yeh as such copy kar dena line .yeh actual response leke ayega 



pm.test('Schema is valid', function () {
    pm.expect(tv4.validate(actualData, schema)).to.be.true;
    
});

Note : In above we are validating jo hamare response mein datatype aa rhe hain har field ke against wohi aa rha hai kya nahe 
Postman mein you can validate using tiny validator (under test tab).

		String color_Before_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;  
		jsExecutor.executeScript("arguments[0].style.background='green'", emailTxtBox);  
		
		String color_After_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		//Verfuing actually colour has changed or not 
		
		if(color_Before_Highlight.equals(color_After_Highlight)) {
			driver.quit();

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.asPrettyString());
		
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Status Code is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.statusCode());
		
		System.out.println("**********Headers are :: ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.headers());
		
		Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));
		
		return Res;

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is ItestListners ?
Ans :  ITestListener is the most adopted TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver. Providing you with an easy to implement interface through a normal Java class, where the class overrides every method declared inside the ITestListener

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Listeners in TestNG?
Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. As the name suggests Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are many types of TestNG listeners available.

AnnotationTransformer ,
IAnnotationTransformer2 ,
IConfigurable ,
IConfigurationListener ,
IExecutionListener,
IHookable ,
IInvokedMethodListener ,
IInvokedMethodListener2 ,
IMethodInterceptor ,
IReporter,
ISuiteListener,
ITestListener .

ITestListener has following methods

OnStart- OnStart method is called when any Test starts.
onTestSuccess- onTestSuccess method is called on the success of any Test.
onTestFailure- onTestFailure method is called on the failure of any Test.
onTestSkipped- onTestSkipped method is called on skipped of any Test.
onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage- method is called each time Test fails but is

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What isis diff between onstart method and beforetest ?
Ans 
OnStart will run at the statof the test method havign annonation as @test at the top.

Beforetest will run for he mthods having annonations @test 

Before test wil run first and then on start will run 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements. Similarly, one can use @FindBy with different location strategies to find web elements and perform actions on them
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can we move to element from source to desitinaion in seleniu without using action class ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?
Ans ->We have invocation count attribute in @test annotiation. We can write invocation count as 3 if we want to run it 3 times. Apart from that we can write threadpull.size if we want to run that case in multiple thread.

 @Test(invocationCount = 3)
=========================================================Added on 24 Aug =======================================================================
Q:Put vs Patch ?
Ans :The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:If you are not able to find any element then what techniques you will apply.
Ans : Might be a possibility that the element can be under some frame , so it is not foundable .To deal with , jump to that frame and work on it .Once work is done come back to original frame.

Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. 

Ans : – JSON, XML, HTML, text
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Breaking changes in API 

Ans -What Is a Breaking Change?

As the name might suggest, a breaking change to an API is any change that can break a client’s application. Usually, breaking changes involve modifying or deleting existing parts of an API.

With the latter, deletion, it’s inevitable that applications break. If a client is consuming the deleted resource, field, or structure, parts of their application will cease to function. The extent to which this really “breaks” the application can vary greatly, from having a minor cosmetic effect to making the application entirely unusable; regardless, deletion is still considered a breaking change.

Modification is less likely to break applications. Even if a client is using the resource, field, or endpoint that is modified, there’s a chance their application will continue to work as normal, depending on the implementation. For example, if a multimedia API goes from returning JPEGs to PNGs, applications that save those file types as well will most likely continue to work.

Of course, modification still carries a genuine risk of breaking client applications. Since the responsible API owner doesn’t leave these things to chance, modifications should also be treated as breaking changes.
Examples

Common examples of breaking changes include:

    Deleting a resource or method
    Deleting a response field
    Modifying a resource or method URI
    Modifying a field name
    Modifying required query parameters
    Modifying authorization
    Modifying rate-limiting
	
	
Best Practices for Breaking Changes
====================================
If you want to take the best possible care of your clients (and you should!), there are quite a few best practices you can adopt to avoid and mitigate breaking changes. Let’s start with how you can avoid them, since this is always preferable for developers:

    Test your code for accidental breaking changes. Breaking changes are particularly troublesome if you don’t know they’re there. Thankfully, there’s an easy solution for API owners that build against an OpenAPI specification: openapi-diff. This open-source tool compares two OpenAPI (v3) specifications and alerts you if any (obvious) breaking changes have been made.
    Future-proof your documentation. It might be cliché, but documentation really can help you avoid breaking changes — especially additive ones. For example, in the early stages of a platform, some objects may consist of just a few fields. If you know considerably more fields will be added in the future, you can instruct clients to expect this and build their applications against it.
    Carefully plan your API in advance. Once again, it might be obvious, but the importance of carefully planning your APIs cannot be understated. Even something as mundane as naming can result in breaking changes — or a persistently bad developer experience — if poorly planned.

Q:What Are Web Services?

Answer: A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet like inter-process communication on a single computer.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Messaging In Restful Web Services?

Answer: A client sends a message in the form of an HTTP Request and the server responds in the form of an HTTP Response. This technique is termed Messaging. These messages contain message data and metadata i.e. information about the message itself.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Request?
Answer: An HTTP Request has five major parts :

    Verb − Indicate HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc.
    URI − Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify the resource on the server.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Request Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Request message as key-value pairs. For example, client ( or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of the message body, cache settings, etc.
    Request Body − Message content or Resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Response?
Answer: An HTTP Response has four major parts:-

    Status/Response Code − Indicate Server status for the requested resource. For example, 404 means resource not found and 200 means response is ok.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Response Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Response message as key-value pairs. For example, content length, content type, response date, server type, etc.
    Response Body − Response message content or Resource representation.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following is the disadvantage of statelessness in RESTful web services:-

Web services need to get extra information in each request and then interpret to get the client’s state in case client interactions are to be taken care of.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Do You Mean By Idempotent Operation?
Answer: Idempotent operations mean their result will always the same no matter how many times these operations are invoked.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Idempotent?
Answer: PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Read-Only?

Answer: GET operations are read-only and are safe.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Caching?

Answer: Caching refers to storing server responses in the client itself so that a client needs not to make a server request for the same resource again and again. A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Created?
Answer: The date header provides the date and time of the resource when it was created.

Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Last Modified?
Answer: Last Modified header provides the date and time of the resource when it was last modified.


Q:Which Header Of Http Response Provides Control Over Caching?
Answer: Cache-Control is the primary header to control caching.

Q:Which Header Of Http Response Sets Expiration Date And Time Of Caching?
Answer: Expires header sets expiration date and time of caching.

Q:Why string is immutable 
Q: Why multiple inhertance not possibe in java 
Q: Polynorphism


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q:Example of method overridiing in selenium 

Ans : WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?

Ans -Usage of Interfaces and Abstract classes is needed for better architectural design for better scalability, maintainability and less painful to make a bigger change.

Example : 
There is an entrepreneur who wants to start a “Construction service provider” company and wants to onboard three builders discussed above. All three builders were ready to be part of the entrepreneur ‘s company but they kept below conditions:

We will not share our techniques or style of getting work done with you. You just need to give the tasks to do and do not care how we will do that.


More or less same story with Selenium WebDriver as well. The purpose of Selenium WebDriver to automate browsers but they do not know how each browser works internally.

Every browser has their own logic to perform browser’s actions such as Launching a browser, closing a browser, loading URL, handling different type of web elements. Same operations are performed in different ways by different browsers.

Without knowing internal working mechanisms of browsers, Selenium WebDriver developers can not write codes to perform actions. If they get to know the internal mechanism some how, it will be difficult to manage when internal mechanism changes and this should not break flow for other browsers.

So to make it simple, a contract is placed between Selenium WebDriver developers and browsers and that contract is in form of WebDriver. A WebDriver consist of all related basic methods which could be performed on a browser.


WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

====================================================================
Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q: What is the best approach method to perform API testing?
The following factors should be considered when performing API testing:

Defining the correct input parameters
Verifying the calls of the mixture of two or more added value parameters
Defining the basic functionality and scope of the API program
Writing appropriate API test cases and making use of testing techniques such as equivalence class, boundary value, etc. to check the operability
Testing case execution
Comparing the test result with the expected result
Verifying the API behavior under conditions such as connection to files and so on.

===============================================================================================================================================

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is API documentation?
Ans : The API documentation is a complete, accurate technical writing giving instructions on how to effectively use and integrate with an API. It is a compact reference manual that has all the information needed to work with the API, and helps you answer all the API testing questions with details on functions, classes, return types, arguments, and also examples and tutorials.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?

Ans :The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.
=============================Questions added on 01-Sep=============================================================================================
Q:What is difference b/w String s=new String(),String s=””;

Ans : In Java String s=new String() will create a new String object and assign the reference to the variable s
But String s="xyz"
create new String object in the Stack with the value "xyz" assign to the variable s
the second method if we are trying to create new String sample="xyz"
the reference value which is previously created for s is used


String str1= “Strings are immutable”;

In this object of String is created.Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the string constant pool first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool.

2. String str2= new String(“Strings are immutable”);

As we saw above that when we tried to assign the same string object to two different literals, compiler only created one object and made both of the literals to point the same object. To overcome that approach we can create strings like this:

String str1 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
String str2 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
In this case compiler would create two different object in memory having the same string.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:what is Dictionary in java?
Ans : 
A java dictionary is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key, its corresponding value can be stored and retrieved as needed; thus, a dictionary is a list of key-value pairs.

The first step to creating a dictionary in Java is to choose a class that implements a “key-value pair” interface; a few examples include HashTables, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Example : 

/ creating a My HashTable Dictionary
		Hashtable<String, String> my_dict = new Hashtable<String, String>();

    // Using a few dictionary Class methods
		// using put method
		my_dict.put("01", "Apple");
		my_dict.put("10", "Banana");
		
		// using get() method
    System.out.println("\nValue at key = 10 : " + my_dict.get("10")); 
    System.out.println("Value at key = 11 : " + my_dict.get("11"));

Q:Agile requirements 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM_m6EzMg3k


Ans : EPIC ------->Feature -------> User Story -------> Task

Scrum Roles -------> Product owner  -------> Scrum master -------> Scurm Team 


1.Product Owner -  Understanding req of customer , he notes what customer wants & he understand what is the req . Documents what customer wants in form of epic , maintains product backlog ( tracks what status the software is ) , team members will pick itmes from product backlog , Product owner also manabegs the release 

Product Backlog - In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.


2.Scrum master - He is intermediater between product owner and team , He checks if the scrum is correctly forllowed , he also makes sure team breaks down feature into story , he manages the things between  team , helps to resolve the roadblock if any .


3.Scrum Team - works on delivery , ike dev team , QA team . if they have any issue they can contact scrum owner

Userstories broken into small stories and stroies to be delivered into small time .This is called Sprint .

Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done

Explanation 
1.Story - jo kaam aaya hai jaise add payment method as payonline / add some button on UI / ya kuch bhe 
2.To Do - Jo kaam shuru karna hai say you picked user story - Add button to UI 
3.In progress - Yaha woh kaam ayega aap kar rhe ho presently 
4.Testing - Jis feature ki teating kar rhe ho
5.Done - Jo develop aur test donno ho chuke hain

Q:Why Jira 

Ans - Bug management , Agile process management , Project management tool, helps tp create backlogs , create sprints , create tasks , create bugs , manage multiple release , can be integrated with CI tools , helps to update tasks , code integrate , manage tasks on the board
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Product Backlog ?
Ans : 
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  


In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.

===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is agile and ohase in agile 

Ans : Agile is a iterative approach in which the deliverables are deilievred in small span of time.

Phases ::

Q:Which option is incorrect 

child ch = new Parent ()?
Parent PP = new Child():
Child CH = new Child();
Parent PP = new Parent();


Ans : A 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Use of constructor ?

Ans : he purpose of constructor is to initialize the object of a class while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code. Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and synchronised while methods can be.


Constructor as the name suggest are useful for creating objects.  Constructor is not a method because it does not have any return type. Not void also. In fact the main difference between constructor and a method is that constructor does not have return type while methods must have return types.
In any object oriented programming language you can not create an instance of class without constructor. So they are provided by default by the compiler if you are not providing one.

Q:Q:Q:Is the JVM platform-independent.
Ans - No
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are hashmap and HashSet? Explain?
Ans: HashMap and HashSet both are one of the most important classes of Java Collection framework. … HashMap Stores elements in form of key-value pair i.e each element has its corresponding key which is required for its retrieval during iteration. HashSet stores only objects no such key value pairs maintained.

Q:What is Agile Methodology?
• In the Agile methodology, each project is broken up into several ‘Iterations’.
• AGILE is a methodology that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing 
throughout the software development life cycle of the project. Both development and testing 
activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model.
• All Iterations should be of the same time duration (between 2 to 8 weeks).
• At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered.
• Any remaining features that cannot be delivered in the first iteration will be taken up in the 
next iteration or subsequent iterations, based on priority.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Difference between defect, error, bug, failure and fault?

A mistake in coding is called error. 
Error found by tester is called defect.
Defect accepted by development team then it is called bug.
Build does not meet the requirements then it is failure.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is white box testing and list the types of white box testing?

White box testing technique involves selection of test cases based on an analysis of the internal 
structure (Code coverage, branches coverage, paths coverage, condition coverage etc.) Of a 
component or system. It is also known as Code-Based testing or Structural testing. Different types of 
white box testing are:
• Statement Coverage.
• Decision Coverage.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Mention what are the different types of test coverage techniques?

Different types of test coverage techniques include :-
Statement Coverage: It verifies that each line of source code has been executed and tested.
Decision Coverage: It ensures that every decision in the source code is executed and tested.
Path Coverage: It ensures that every possible route through a given part of code is executed and 
tested

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is casting ?

Ans : Converting one data type to another . 
Types 

1.)) Implicit ---- Widening ----------> Converts smaller data type to bigger , happens automatically [equals ke left side bada hoga]
2.)) Explicit casting -----Narrowing ----------> Converts bigger data type to smaller , manually programmer has to do it [equals ke left sise jab chota ho aur right se bada ho , tab explicit use hoga]


Implicit example :: int -> byte , int -> float , float -> decimal


Explicit example :: byte -> int , decimal-> float 


few examples 
1.) double dd = 4; // implicit (automatically casting ho jaeygi , kyn ki left mein bada hai) 
2.) int ii = 4.75;  // this will give error 

it should be int i = (int)4.75;

3.)float f = 4; // implicit casting 

4.)float f = 4.75; // this will give error 

it should be float f = (float) 4.55;

5.) double  f = 4.55; //implicit casting

Q:How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a JVM?
Answer: JVM is Java Virtual Machine which is a run time environment for the compiled java class files.

Q:What is the difference in Collections and Collection in java.
Collection is an interface in java whereas Collections is a utility class has static java methods inside it.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Status code 202 ?Other Status codes in API ?

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.
503-Server Unavialble
501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 
500 (Internal Server Error)
400-Bad Request
415 (Unsupported Media Type)
412 (Precondition Failed)
404 (Not Found)
401 (Unauthorized)
201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content
202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Super 
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Public class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  

Public class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
Public void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  i.e black 
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  i.e white

Q: What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.
=============================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }

Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.

What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

13 What is constructor overloading?
Answer : Same as method overloading, Single class can have multiple constructors with same name as class name but all have different signatures (different input parameters and types) is called constructor overloading. 
==============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there.

==============================================================================
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
java.lang package is imported by default and we don’t need to import any class from this package explicitly.
==============================================================================
What is static keyword?
static keyword can be used with class level variables to make it global i.e all the objects will share the same variable.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
=============================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
============================================================================
Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order

Q: What is  differences between API and Web Service?

All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.

===================================================================================================================================
Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.
============================================================================
Q:: Can we test APIs or web services using Selenium webdriver?
No selenium webdriver uses browser's native method to automate the web applications. Since web services are headless, so we cannot automate web services using selenium webdriver.

==============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.

==============================================================================
What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

===============================================================================
Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?

public class Test { 
    public static void foo() { 
        System.out.println("Test.foo() called "); 
    } 
    public static void foo(int a) {

        Test.foo(); 
        Test.foo(10); 
    } 
} 

===============================================================================
18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}


----Another example 

Interface 
Public  interface X
{
   public void myMethod();//abstract method 
}

Public interface Y
{
   public void myMethod();
}

Public  class JavaExample implements X, Y
{
   public void myMethod()
   {
       System.out.println("Implementing more than one interfaces");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
	   JavaExample obj = new JavaExample();

42. What is fluent wait in selenium?
A fluent wait is a type of wait in which we can also specify polling interval(intervals after which driver will try to find the element) along with the maximum timeout value.

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Example of explicit wait 
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Syntax :
Implicit wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);	
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;	

explicit wait :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

11) What is the difference between System Testing and Functional Testing? 
System Testing is a Test Level 
Functional Testing is a Test Type that can be performed in all levels of Testing (Unit Testing, Integration Testing, system Testing and Acceptance Testing)
===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.

What is Java Annotations?
Annotations is a metadata that are used to provide supplement information about a program.
Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler

Question: What do you mean by Collections in Java? What are the constituents of Collections in Java?
Answer: A group of objects in Java is known as collections. collections can be considered as a framework designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following operations on objects:

Deletion
Insertion
Manipulation
Searching
Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

Classes – Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector
Interfaces – Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and Sorted Set
Maps – HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
Queues – Priority Queue
Sets – Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set

Question: How does the throw keyword differ from the throws keyword?
1.)Throw used inside a function and Throws used in the signature of the function 
2.)Throw can throw one exception at a time , throws can handle multiple exception at a time seperated by comma 

Example 

Public void Demo() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException 
{ 
// Statements where exceptions might occur. 
throw new ArithmeticException(); 
}

10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include? 
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base

*Q: Example of static class 

class OuterClass {
    private static String msg = "GeeksForGeeks";
  
    // Static nested class
    public static class NestedStaticClass {
  
        // Only static members of Outer class
        // is directly accessible in nested
        // static class
        public void printMessage()
        {
  
            // Try making 'message' a non-static
            // variable, there will be compiler error
            System.out.println(
                "Message from nested static class: "
                + msg);
        }
    }
  
  
Advantage of static class - Nested class to be mase as static class , it can use any variable of outer class even without intializing .example dekho upar wala 
===============================================================================
Q:Can Constructor can be private 

Ans Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.
=================================================NNIIPPUUNNVVEERRMMAA==============================
Question: Can a class be private?
Answer: Only nested or inner classes can be private because they can be accessed by the outer class. A normal class cannot be final because you can not instantiate it (create object).
===============================================================================
Question: How is a constant variable different from a global variable?
Answer: Global variables can be modified and are accessible by all the functions in a program. Constant variables have a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the program.

Q:Which is the only browser that supports Selenium IDE to be used?
Firefox
===============================================================================
public class TestNG {
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 
 @Test (priority = 0)
 public void CloseBrowser() {
 driver.close();
 System.out.println("Closing Google Chrome browser");
 }
 
 @Test (priority = -1)
 public void OpenBrowser() {
 System.out.println("Launching Google Chrome browser");         
 driver.get("https://www.demoqa.com");
 }
 
 @Test
 public void AccountTest(){
 System.out.println("Some tests for Customer Account");
 }
}


Answer - first -1 priority wale method will run ---> then Account test wala and at last 0 prioty wala
Observe that the AccountTest method ran before CloseBrowser even without having any priority because both sets to priority = 0, and hence, they run alphabetically.

===============================================================================
Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}  
}

Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.

import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")

What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
===============================================================================

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

===============================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object 
===============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
===============================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What do you mean by User Defined Exception?
Ans: User Defined Exception or custom exception is creating your own exception class and throws that exception using ‘throw’ keyword. This can be done by extending the class Exception. … The keyword “throw” is used to create a new Exception and throw it to the catch block.
===============================================================================================================================================
Java concepts

In a Java file we can have multiple classes but there should be only one public class
If we need to create one variable for multiple values, we need to use Array concept.
Int marks[] = new int[5]

priorityQueue is class which implements Set Interface.

Q:Q:Different String methods:

Ans -
compareTo – The Java String compareTo() method is used for comparing two strings lexicographically.
boolean equals() – The java string equals() method compares the two given strings based on the content of the string (case sensitive)
String concat() – concat two strings
boolean equalsIgnoreCase() – The java string equals() method compares the two given strings based on the content of the string (not casesensitive)
char charAt() – index position – The java string charAt() method returns a char value at the given index number.
boolean contains()
toUpperCase() – convert to upper case
toLowerCase() – convert to lower case
trim() – remove spaces from both sides of string
substring() —  returns part of string
boolean endsWith()
boolean startWith() – ends with specified suffix or not
int length()
replace()

Q:Difference between where and having and use of it?

Ans -The WHERE clause in MySQL is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries to filter data from the table or relation. The WHERE clause in MySQL can also implement the logical connectives AND, OR, and NOT

    SELECT column_lists,     
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists;  
	
	

Having -
HAVING clause in MySQL used in conjunction with GROUP BY clause enables us to specify conditions that filter which group results appear in the result. 

    SELECT column_lists,     
    aggregate_function (expression)    
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q:2. Explain the review process you follow in your organization? 
A. The various phases of the review process followed in my organization are: 
Planning: >selecting the personal for review >allocating roles >defining entry and exit criteria. 
Kick-off: >Distributing documents >explaining the objectives >checking entry criteria, etc.
Individual preparation: > in the phase, each of the participants will work before the review meeting and be ready with questions and comments. 
Review Meeting: > Discussion among the review members by going through each line of the work product. > Logging comments > Making decision about the defect.
Rework: > Fixing defects found during the review, typically done by the author. 
Follow-up: > checking the defects that have been addressed. >gathering metrics and checking the exit criteria.
----------------------------------------------------
23. What are the roles present in the review? 

==Manager: >decides on execution of reviews. > allocates time in project schedules. > determines if the review objectives have met.
==Moderator: >leads the review, including planning and running the meeting >follows-up after the meeting. 
==Author: The author is the person who has created the item to be reviewed. the author may also be asked questions within the review. 
==Reviewer: The reviewer are the attendees of the review who attempt to find errors in the item under review. they should come from different perspectives in order to provide a well balanced review of the item.
==scribe: The scribe or recorder is the person who is responsible for documenting issues raised during the process of the review meeting
----------------------------------------------------
29. Explain what do you document during the review process? 
A. we document page and line number of defect, origin of defect, severity of defect. We also document other information like work product ID, reviewers, etc

===============================================================================

Q:Ques.20. What is defect density?

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q:Union and UnionAll 

Ans : 
UNION :
The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.

To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have

The same number of columns selected
The same number of column expressions
The same data type and
Have them in the same order


UNION ALL :

The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements including duplicate rows.

The same rules that apply to the UNION clause will apply to the UNION ALL operator.

Q:Q:What is use of intern() method ?
Ans : The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap memory and stores it in the String constant pool. Note that, if another String with the same contents exists in the String constant pool, then a new object won't be created and the new reference will point to the other String.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why we cannot crate an object of abstract and interface ?
Ans : No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class because it does not have a complete implementation. 
The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses. It acts like a template, or an empty or partially empty structure, you should extend it and build on it before you can use it.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:what is super most class in java and explain all methods of the superclass?

Q:Q:What is collision in Hashmap ?
Ans : Collisions in the HashMap
A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.


collision resolution techniques comes into play only when multiple keys end up with the same hashcode (i.e., they fall in the same bucket location) where an entry is already stored. HashMap handles the collision resolution by using the concept of chaining i.e., it stores the values in a linked list 

chaining, i.e. they use linked list to store map entries which ended in the same bucket due to a collision. If a key end up in the same bucket location where entry is already stored then this entry is just added at the head of the linked list there.

Q:Q:Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following is the disadvantage of statelessness in RESTful web services:-

Web services need to get extra information in each request and then interpret to get the client’s state in case client interactions are to be taken care of.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q::Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Git ammend command ?

Ans : The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. 


--->git commit --amend
The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works basically the same way — first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Q:Clone() method ?

Ans:  The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object of a class which implements Cloneable interface. By default, it does field-by-field copy as the Object class doesn't have any idea about the members of the particular class whose objects call this method.

Q:14. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.


UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a series of specific tests which determines whether the product will meet the needs of its users.
User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios

Q:Q:. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

--Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
--Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
--Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
--Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Q:*********Q:Why would it be more secure to store sensitive data (such as a password, social security number, etc.) in a character array rather than in a String?

Ans - In Java, Strings are immutable and are stored in the String pool. What this means is that, once a String is created, it stays in the pool in memory until being garbage collected. Therefore, even after you’re done processing the string value (e.g., the password), it remains available in memory for an indeterminate period of time thereafter (again, until being garbage collected) which you have no real control over. Therefore, anyone having access to a memory dump can potentially extract the sensitive data and exploit it.

In contrast, if you use a mutable object like a character array, for example, to store the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it with confidence that it will no longer be retained in memory.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Compare the sleep() and wait() methods in Java, including when and why you would use one vs. the other.

Ans -sleep() is a blocking operation that keeps a hold on the monitor / lock of the shared object for the specified number of milliseconds.

wait(), on the other hand, simply pauses the thread until either (a) the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed or (b) it receives a desired notification from another thread (whichever is first), without keeping a hold on the monitor/lock of the shared object.

sleep() is most commonly used for polling, or to check for certain results, at a regular interval. wait() is generally used in multithreaded applications, in conjunction with notify() / notifyAll(), to achieve synchronization and avoid race conditions.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What are static initializers and when would you use them?

Ans - A static initializer gives you the opportunity to run code during the initial loading of a class and it guarantees that this code will only run once and will finish running before your class can be accessed in any way.

Q:Why string is immutable 
Q: Why multiple inhertance not possibe in java 
Q: Polynorphism


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q:Example of method overridiing in selenium 

Ans : WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?

Ans -Usage of Interfaces and Abstract classes is needed for better architectural design for better scalability, maintainability and less painful to make a bigger change.

Example : 
There is an entrepreneur who wants to start a “Construction service provider” company and wants to onboard three builders discussed above. All three builders were ready to be part of the entrepreneur ‘s company but they kept below conditions:

We will not share our techniques or style of getting work done with you. You just need to give the tasks to do and do not care how we will do that.


More or less same story with Selenium WebDriver as well. The purpose of Selenium WebDriver to automate browsers but they do not know how each browser works internally.

Every browser has their own logic to perform browser’s actions such as Launching a browser, closing a browser, loading URL, handling different type of web elements. Same operations are performed in different ways by different browsers.

Without knowing internal working mechanisms of browsers, Selenium WebDriver developers can not write codes to perform actions. If they get to know the internal mechanism some how, it will be difficult to manage when internal mechanism changes and this should not break flow for other browsers.

So to make it simple, a contract is placed between Selenium WebDriver developers and browsers and that contract is in form of WebDriver. A WebDriver consist of all related basic methods which could be performed on a browser.


WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:What is the test environment of API?

Ans : Setting up the API’s test environment is not an easy task, so you should have a ready answer if your API testing interview is coming. The test environment of API is a bit complete and requires the configuration of the database and server, depending on the software requirements. No GUI (Graphical User Interface) is available in this test form.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the common API testing types?

Ans : Validation Testing
Functional Testing
UI testing
Load testing
Runtime/ Error Detection
Security testing
Penetration testing
Fuzz testing
Interoperability and WS Compliance testing

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What is the best approach method to perform API testing?
The following factors should be considered when performing API testing:

Defining the correct input parameters
Verifying the calls of the mixture of two or more added value parameters
Defining the basic functionality and scope of the API program
Writing appropriate API test cases and making use of testing techniques such as equivalence class, boundary value, etc. to check the operability
Testing case execution
Comparing the test result with the expected result
Verifying the API behavior under conditions such as connection to files and so on.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are differences between API Testing and Unit Testing

Q: What kinds of bugs that API testing would often find?

Ans Missing or duplicate functionality
Fails to handle error conditions gracefully
Stress
Reliability
Security
Unused flags
Not implemented errors
Inconsistent error handling
Performance
Multi-threading issues
Improper error
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is API documentation?
Ans : The API documentation is a complete, accurate technical writing giving instructions on how to effectively use and integrate with an API. It is a compact reference manual that has all the information needed to work with the API, and helps you answer all the API testing questions with details on functions, classes, return types, arguments, and also examples and tutorials.

Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?

Ans :The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.
=============================Questions added on 01-Sep=============================================================================================
Q:What is difference b/w String s=new String(),String s=””;

Ans : In Java String s=new String() will create a new String object and assign the reference to the variable s
But String s="xyz"
create new String object in the Stack with the value "xyz" assign to the variable s
the second method if we are trying to create new String sample="xyz"
the reference value which is previously created for s is used


String str1= “Strings are immutable”;

In this object of String is created.Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the string constant pool first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool.

2. String str2= new String(“Strings are immutable”);

As we saw above that when we tried to assign the same string object to two different literals, compiler only created one object and made both of the literals to point the same object. To overcome that approach we can create strings like this:

String str1 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
String str2 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
In this case compiler would create two different object in memory having the same string.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,

Q:what is Dictionary in java?
Ans : 
A java dictionary is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key, its corresponding value can be stored and retrieved as needed; thus, a dictionary is a list of key-value pairs.

The first step to creating a dictionary in Java is to choose a class that implements a “key-value pair” interface; a few examples include HashTables, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Example : 

/ creating a My HashTable Dictionary
		Hashtable<String, String> my_dict = new Hashtable<String, String>();

    // Using a few dictionary Class methods
		// using put method
		my_dict.put("01", "Apple");
		my_dict.put("10", "Banana");
		
		// using get() method
    System.out.println("\nValue at key = 10 : " + my_dict.get("10")); 
    System.out.println("Value at key = 11 : " + my_dict.get("11"));

Q:Agile requirements 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM_m6EzMg3k


Ans : EPIC ------->Feature -------> User Story -------> Task

Scrum Roles -------> Product owner  -------> Scrum master -------> Scurm Team 


1.Product Owner -  Understanding req of customer , he notes what customer wants & he understand what is the req . Documents what customer wants in form of epic , maintains product backlog ( tracks what status the software is ) , team members will pick itmes from product backlog , Product owner also manabegs the release 

Product Backlog - In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.


2.Scrum master - He is intermediater between product owner and team , He checks if the scrum is correctly forllowed , he also makes sure team breaks down feature into story , he manages the things between  team , helps to resolve the roadblock if any .


3.Scrum Team - works on delivery , ike dev team , QA team . if they have any issue they can contact scrum owner 




Sprint Activities ::
--------------------------
Userstories broken into small stories and stroies to be delivered into small time .This is called Sprint .

Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done

Explanation 
1.Story - jo kaam aaya hai jaise add payment method as payonline / add some button on UI / ya kuch bhe 
2.To Do - Jo kaam shuru karna hai say you picked user story - Add button to UI 
3.In progress - Yaha woh kaam ayega aap kar rhe ho presently 
4.Testing - Jis feature ki teating kar rhe ho
5.Done - Jo develop aur test donno ho chuke hain

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Product Backlog ?
Ans : 
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).

Q:What is difference between sel 3 &4

Ans : The architecture for Selenium 3 includes the JSON Wire Protocol. However, Selenium 4 does not include the JSON Wire Protocol, and that’s the contrast between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON Protocol is used to transfer information between Selenium client (webDriver) and Browser driver 


Sekenium 4 ::
Selenium 4 has direct communication between the client and server. The client still has 2 parts (Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings) while Browser Drivers are the server.

Selenium Client sends out a request to perform a command.
The WebDriver Language Bindings is a code library designed to drive actions.
Browser Drivers receive the request and then return a response after an automation Test Script executes on the Web Browser:


Selenium4 is more stable then selenium 3.

Q:Use of constructor ?

Ans : he purpose of constructor is to initialize the object of a class while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code. Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and synchronised while methods can be.


Constructor as the name suggest are useful for creating objects.  Constructor is not a method because it does not have any return type. Not void also. In fact the main difference between constructor and a method is that constructor does not have return type while methods must have return types.
In any object oriented programming language you can not create an instance of class without constructor. So they are provided by default by the compiler if you are not providing one.

Q:How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.

Q:Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Status code 202 ?Other Status codes in API ?

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.
503-Server Unavialble
501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 
500 (Internal Server Error)
400-Bad Request
415 (Unsupported Media Type)
412 (Precondition Failed)
404 (Not Found)
401 (Unauthorized)
201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content
202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

Q:What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Super 
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Public class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  

Public class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
Public void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  i.e black 
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  i.e white
}

Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.
=============================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}

Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.
==============================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.

What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

13 What is constructor overloading?
Answer : Same as method overloading, Single class can have multiple constructors with same name as class name but all have different signatures (different input parameters and types) is called constructor overloading. 
==============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
=============================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
============================================================================
Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order

Q: What is  differences between API and Web Service?

All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.

===================================================================================================================================
Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.
============================================================================
Q:: Can we test APIs or web services using Selenium webdriver?
No selenium webdriver uses browser's native method to automate the web applications. Since web services are headless, so we cannot automate web services using selenium webdriver.

==============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.

==============================================================================
What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

===============================================================================
Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?
A regular expression is a special text string used for describing a search pattern. In Selenium IDE regular expression can be used with the keyword- regexp: as a prefix to the value and patterns needs to be included for the expected values.

What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Tst(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)

18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}


----Another example 

Interface 
Public  interface X
{
   public void myMethod();//abstract method 
}

Public interface Y
{
   public void myMethod();
}

Public  class JavaExample implements X, Y
{
   public void myMethod()
   {
       System.out.println("Implementing more than one interfaces");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){

42. What is fluent wait in selenium?
A fluent wait is a type of wait in which we can also specify polling interval(intervals after which driver will try to find the element) along with the maximum timeout value.

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Example of explicit wait 
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Syntax :
Implicit wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);	
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;	

explicit wait :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}

What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
===============================================================================

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

===============================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object

What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Q:Can you explain RequestSpecification request = RestAssured.given();

Ans -RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like. This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
Also , it will hep us to modify the request like adding header , chnaging some parameter

Q:What is refractoring ?

Ans : Making your code more clean . and removing uncessary cheeze jo aap use bhe nahe kar rhe . jaise koi variable define kar diya n that is not going to be used throughout the script - as per refractoring remove it .

You dnt change the logic , you make the code more good using some good things / concepts 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is synchronization?

Ans : Multiple resources can use a single thread .
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which is more faster and efficient string builder or string buffer 

Ans : String builder as this is non synchronization 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why we need collection , whay collections are there 

Ans : Before collections we use to use array , which has a limitation that whatever size is defined at the time of decalaring a array , it cannot be increased later on .Agar size 5 diya hai to aur 6 element add kar diye then you will get error - arrayoutofbound .

To overcome this concern we have collections like arraylist , linkedlist 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Basic methods present in collection interface 

Ans : add , remove , addall , removeall , retainall , size(), clear(), isempty()

All the interfaces like set , queue , list which extends interface(collection) will have all the metnhods which collection interface has 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Will this be diff List list = new ArrayList<>(); and  List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>()

Ans : No doubt there is not any diff , hwoever it is always suggeted to pass the generic 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can list/set be declared as final say final List list = new ArrayList<>();

Ans : Yes , even after declaring it as final you can still add or remove anything 


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we have multiple public classes in a java source file?
We can’t have more than one public class in a single java source file. A single source file can have multiple classes that are not public.
===============================================================================================================================================
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader. It is used to initialize static variables of the class. Mostly it’s used to create static resources when class is loaded.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is listners

Q:What is story point in agile 

Ans : Caluclating the story point in the basis of the complexity of the task , how much difficiult it is , how much hours / efforts it will consume ,based on that story points are calculated .

Say if you are test simple UI .you can take 1-2 story points , however when end to end flow needs to be checked then you may consume 405 story points 

===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}  
}

Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.


package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase1()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase1");  
 }  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase2()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase2");  
 }  
 @Test(dependsOnGroups="test")  
 public void testcase3()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase3");  
 }  
}  

===============================================================================
What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 

===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

===============================================================================
Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 

===============================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.

===============================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 

===============================================================================
Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 

===============================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Difference git pull and git fetch ?

git fetch pulls latest changes done by other devs from remote reporsiroty to local repo and then you have to run merge command to merge the changes in your local

git pull -Download and merges the changes in your local.
===============================================================================
Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

	String ttt = tt.getText();
	System.out.print("Text Extracted = " + ttt);
	Boolean abc = tt.isDisplayed();

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

===============================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.

===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===============================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",

              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

Ans -Constructor cannot be static because it cannot be call as method or variable, so no need to placing a static variable before constructor. abstract means incomplete, for complementing it we need an implementation class/interface. Constructor doesn't required to be abstract because it doesn't need to be implemented.
===============================================================================
Q:33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

This way variables cannot be called in another class .
===============================================================================
35. Why do we mark main method as static in Java?

===============================================================================
43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return
type of method in java?

Overloading is the mechanism of binding the method call with the method body dynamically based on the parameters passed to the method call. ... It is not possible to decide to execute which method based on the return type, therefore, overloading is not possible just by changing the return type of the method.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.
===============================================================================

What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

2. How do we achieve parallel execution in TestNG?
Parallel testing or parallel execution, as the name suggests, is a process of running the test case parallelly rather than one after the other. In parallel testing, the program’s multiple parts (or modules) execute together, saving the testers a lot of time and effort. The operating system’s functionalities do this, but as a user, we need to trigger parallel execution through TestNG. As an example, you can think of having software with two different versions and running them in parallel with the help of TestNG. Parallel execution would give us the correct idea of the stability and performance of the software much faster than running serially.

Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);

1. What's the fastest locator in Selenium?

Id is fastest and then comes name
===============================================================================
2. What does ::(double colon) in sibling xpaths represent?
A double colon :: is used to separate the axis specifier from the node test.
===============================================================================
4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================

What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?
Since an array is static in nature i.e. you cannot change the size of an array once created, So, if you need an array which can resize itself then you should use the ArrayList.

===============================================================================
Q: WHat is thread in testNG.XML file in case of parallel testing ?

Threads in parallel testing refer to different parts in which the test execution will be divided and run parallelly

So if there are two threads and two methods, they will take one method each and run them parallelly (if we are running the methods parallelly). But if there are three methods and two threads, one will have to wait until one thread is free and takes up that method for execution. Therefore, we need to specify the number of threads we want to run while performing parallel testing in TestNG.


<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name = "Parallel Testing Suite">
   <test name = "Parallel Tests" parallel = "methods" thread-count = "2">--------------------------------Es ki baat ho rhi hai 
      <classes>
         <class name = "ParallelTest" />
      </classes>
   </test>
</suite>


Note - example let us suppose there are 3 methods and you defined thread as 2 .then 2 parallel chalenge , aur jab ek thread free hogi tab woh 3rd method ke liye chalega .In this case 2 methods ka same thread id hoga aur 3rd ka alag ...
===============================================================================
As I mentioned, if we run the test methods directly through the test case file (Run As -> TestNG Test) rather than the XML file, they will run serially. Run the file in the same way (serially) and notice the time taken for overall execution.
===============================================================================
17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.

Drop the pen from some height (Table height) in the upside-down position. Verify if you are able to write with this pen. By mistake, the pen can any time fall on the ground. So testing this possibility to know its impact, will help us in knowing the quality of the pen
===============================================================================
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.

===============================================================================
8) If try With Multiple catch Block Present, Is Order of catch Blocks Important in 
Which Order We Have To Take?

Yes , jaise aapke codd mein pehle arthmetic error aani hai to pehle uske respective catch block hona chaiye ..
agli exception say IO error h , then uske respective block hona chaiye 
===============================================================================
10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--
===============================================================================
11)Is it Possible To Take try, catch Inside try Block?
No , In Java, we can use a try block within a try block. Each time a try statement is entered, the context of that exception is pushed on to a stack

===============================================================================
16)In Which Situation Finally Block Will Not Executed?
Ans - if try block will have a statement System.exit();
===============================================================================
17)If Return Statement Present Inside try, is Finally Block Will Be Executed?
Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed.
===============================================================================
19)Is it Possible To Write Any Statement Between try-catch And finally?
No, we cannot write any statements in between try, catch and finally blocks and these blocks form one unit
===============================================================================
20)Is it Possible To Take 2 finally Blocks For The Same try?
You can only have one finally clause per try/catch/finally statement
===============================================================================
29)Is it Possible To Use throws Keyword For Any Java Class?
No ,It is used in method definition, to declare that a risky method is being called.
===============================================================================

Q:Auto It use ?
Sometimes selenium is helpless to handle the window related stuff , as when you click on some download option lets say a pdf file , you can view it in browser , however download nahe ho pati windows mein

2.After installation it will go to c:/program(x86)/autoit
3.There is a file - Au3Info_x64 - which is basically a finder 
4.Scite is a file which is a editior 

--Commands : controlfocus , controlsetTest,ControlClick(These two be used in AutoIt)

Note : InetGet is used in Auto it to Downloads a file from the internet using the HTTP, HTTPS or FTP protocol.

Run auto it script in selenium

===============================================================================
Q: What are Broken Links?
Broken links are links or URLs that are not reachable. They may be down or not functioning due to some server error

An URL will always have a status with 2xx which is valid. There are different HTTP status codes which are having different purposes. For an invalid request, HTTP status is 4xx and 5xx.

Why should you check Broken links?
You should always make sure that there are no broken links on the site because the user should not land into an error page.

The error happens if the rules are not updated correctly, or the requested resources are not existing at the server.

Manual checking of links is a tedious task, because each webpage may have a large number of links & manual process has to be repeated for all pages.

===============================================================================
Q: what is the tag present for links and images in DOM 

Links ---a--- it will have property href
Images ----img--it will have property href

Collections: HashMap-----key and value. If we have states and cities, which will be the key ?
HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.

17. Automation is running fine kn chrome but failing on IE . What could be the reason.
During cross browser testing, it is sometimes found that one test script fails in one browser, where it passes in a different browser. What is the reason behind this? Is there any specific reason why this happens, for java- selenium web driver, test scripts?


Ans - It happens due to  element locators postions changes from one web page to other webpage
The crazy thing about Chrome, Firefox and IE is that all three run at different speeds. I've found Chrome to be the fastest, Firefox to be the middle ground and IE to be the slowest. That means I typically have to build in enough explicit waits so they pass for Chrome's speed (otherwise I get elements aren't clickable) but make sure my timeouts are high enough so that my IE test runs don't timeout.

62. Is it allowed to mark an method in interface as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.
==============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?

10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--

Q:What is unreachable catch block error?

A block of statements to which the control can never reach under any case can be called as unreachable blocks. Unreachable blocks are not supported by Java. The catch block mentioned with the reference of Exception class should and must be always last catch block because Exception is the superclass of all exceptions. When we are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones.

When you are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones. i.e sub classes of Exception must come first and super classes later. If you keep super classes first and sub classes later, compiler will show unreachable catch block err

Q: Example of method overriding in selenium framework ?

Examples of Method Overriding
In the WebDriver interface, we use two different methods for navigating or accessing any website i.e. driver.get() and driver.navigate().to().

These two methods are examples of Method Overriding.

Enlisted below is the basic difference between the navigate() and get() method and this is frequently asked in Selenium Interviews.

The get() method does not load the web page completely if you are going to do some other operation after loading a page. This is the reason for which get() is faster than navigate().
Using get() method, you can not traverse back and forward whereas Navigate() supports back and forth traversal of a web page using navigate().forward() and navigate().back().

Q:Can abstract class be final in Java?
Ans-No
===============================================================================
Q:Can abstract class contains main method in Java?
Ans-Yes, you can use the main() method in abstract class. The main() method is a static method so it is associated with Class, not with object or instance. The abstract is applicable to the object so there is no problem if it contains the main method.

public void M2(){
system.out.printLn("M2");
}


@Test(groups="smoke" , "regression")
public void M3(){
system.out.printLn("M3");
}

Now you want to run particular group test cases

Q: What is grouping in testNG ?

Ans : TestNG Groups allow you to perform groupings of different test methods. Grouping of test methods is required when you want to access the test methods of different classes.

Jaise 3 classes hain all wants to run method for a group say smoke which we created in testNG.xml file , in that case aap 3 classes mein un un methods ke upar groups mention kar do jaha aap chahato ho woh es group ke liye chale .Kyn ki saari classes ki testNG.xml same he hogi 

example 

package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Personal_loan  
{  
 @Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
 public void WebLoginPersonalLoan()  
 {  
     System.out.println("Web Login Personal Loan");  
 }  
 }
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Home_loan   
{  
@Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
public void MobileLoginHomeLoan()  
{  
  System.out.println("Mobile Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test  
public void APILoginHomeLoan()  
{  
  System.out.println("API Login Home Loan");  
}  
}  




package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Car_loan   
{  
@Test  
public void WebLoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("Web Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test  
public void MobileLoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("Mobile Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
public void APILoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("API Login Home Loan");  
}  
}  



Now, we create a testng.xml file where we configure the classes that we have created and add new tag <groups>. We want to execute those test cases which have a group "SmokeTest".

?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">  
<suite name="test_suite">

Q:TDD vs BDD 


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Real example of Abstrction in sleenoum framework ?
Ans :
These concepts are commonly used in framework development. Abstract class is used in defining a common super class while writing Page Object Model layer of the framework. We usually create an abstract class named BasePage to have all common members for every page written in this class e.g getPageTitle().

Then each Page class (HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage etc.) inherit from BasePage. Sometimes one may need to change the behavior of methods implemented in superclass. So subclass has freedom to override that method where we use polymorphism. This is how we use Abstract class in real projects.

Q:Which is the package which is to be imported while working with WebDriver ?

Ans- org.openqa.selenium
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Use of constructor in selenium?
Ans: Constructor is special method which name is same as class name and it mainly used for initialisation purpose.

Whenerever we create an object of a class constructor gets called and we can initialise objects.

As a part of selenium , we need to syncronize object of WebDriver .ex. - driver

We can have multiple classes for different features but driver should be one and sync with all.

So it is preferable that we should sync driver whenever class getting called.


Also , 
Constructor is one of the approaches how you can initialize elements associated with your page. Here you just use the classic way to initialize everything when you object is being instantiated.

For example: below is the LoginPage’s parameterized constructor which will instantiate webDriver for you with the Object creation of this page itself.

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {            
             this.driver = driver;  
             PageFactory.initElements(driver, this); 
    } 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is API ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the way to represent the resource in REST?
REST uses different representation to define the resources like text, JSON and XML. The most popular representation of resources is JSON and XML.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the characteristics of REST?
Here, are the two characteristics of REST.

REST is stateless. With the use of the REST API the server has no status, we can restart the server between two calls, inspite of all the data is transferred to the server.
Web Services uses POST method to perform operations, while REST uses GET method to access the resources.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is messaging in RESTFUL Web Services?
RESTFUL Web Services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server. This is the technique when the client sends a message in the form of HTTP request the server send back the HTTP reply which is called Messaging.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Diff in C++ and Java ?

Q:Who writes the feature file -----------QA / Dev / BA 
Q:Advantages of cucumber ----It has feature file which uses english like language and anyone read this w/o having any code knowledge
Q:Can we put implicit and explicit all together in same script ------------ 
Ans : Not a good practice , script slow hp jaeygi 

Setting Explicit Wait is important in cases where there are certain elements that naturally take more time to load. If one sets an implicit wait command, then the browser will wait for the same time frame before loading every web element. This causes an unnecessary delay in executing the test script.

Explicit wait is more intelligent, but can only be applied for specified elements. However, it is an improvement on implicit wait since it allows the program to pause for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

Q:What is webServices 

Ans : Services available over web.All webservices are API's , howvever all API's are not webService.

Webservices uses http , api uses json/https
webservices example like rest api and soap

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides 
***WebServices needs internet to use the servoce however API doesnot needs internet to operate ***
Webservices uses post request , API uses any post/put/delete/get

Q:Q:What is JSON ?

Ans : Understanding mein issue aye to refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfshV5n6ac
Java Script object notation - it takes the input in form of key:value pair and it starts with { or [ .{ for jsonObject and [ for jsonArray

JSON Schema : it is a schema / structural validation .Jo bhe response aa rha hai aapko , json schema is validating the expected data type and format .
jaise firstname , lastname a rha hai response mein to unki datatype string honi chaiye ---- to es case mein schema validator yhi confirm karega ki 
fields : firstname , lastname  have datatype string or not 


Steps :
1.Login to https://www.jsonschema.net/home
2.Paste your response here 
3.It will share the scheme with you 
4.Go to postman 
5.Under test tab 
6.Select tiny validator jaise aap status code ke liye karte ho 

Now paste this 



var schema = {
====== Paste ypur schema :: jo aapko yaha se mila hai  https://www.jsonschema.net/home  =============
}


var actualData = pm.response.json(); /////////////////yeh as such copy kar dena line .yeh actual response leke ayega 



pm.test('Schema is valid', function () {
    pm.expect(tv4.validate(actualData, schema)).to.be.true;
    
});

Note : In above we are validating jo hamare response mein datatype aa rhe hain har field ke against wohi aa rha hai kya nahe 
Postman mein you can validate using tiny validator (under test tab).

Q:How to validate schema in postman 

Ans - Using tiny validator which you get under tests
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What are the static imports needed for rest assured automation 
Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.asPrettyString());
		
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Status Code is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.statusCode());
		
		System.out.println("**********Headers are :: ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.headers());
		
		Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is ItestListners ?
Ans :  ITestListener is the most adopted TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver. Providing you with an easy to implement interface through a normal Java class, where the class overrides every method declared inside the ITestListener

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Listeners in TestNG?
Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. As the name suggests Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are many types of TestNG listeners available.

AnnotationTransformer ,
IAnnotationTransformer2 ,
IConfigurable ,
IConfigurationListener ,
IExecutionListener,
IHookable ,
IInvokedMethodListener ,
IInvokedMethodListener2 ,
IMethodInterceptor ,
IReporter,
ISuiteListener,
ITestListener .

ITestListener has following methods

OnStart- OnStart method is called when any Test starts.
onTestSuccess- onTestSuccess method is called on the success of any Test.
onTestFailure- onTestFailure method is called on the failure of any Test.
onTestSkipped- onTestSkipped method is called on skipped of any Test.
onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage- method is called each time Test fails but is

Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements. Similarly, one can use @FindBy with different location strategies to find web elements and perform actions on them
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can we move to element from source to desitinaion in seleniu without using action class ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?
Ans ->We have invocation count attribute in @test annotiation. We can write invocation count as 3 if we want to run it 3 times. Apart from that we can write threadpull.size if we want to run that case in multiple thread.

 @Test(invocationCount = 3)
=========================================================Added on 24 Aug =======================================================================
Q:Put vs Patch ?
Ans :The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:If you are not able to find any element then what techniques you will apply.
Ans : Might be a possibility that the element can be under some frame , so it is not foundable .To deal with , jump to that frame and work on it .Once work is done come back to original frame.

Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. 

Ans : – JSON, XML, HTML, text
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Breaking changes in API 

Ans -What Is a Breaking Change?

As the name might suggest, a breaking change to an API is any change that can break a client’s application. Usually, breaking changes involve modifying or deleting existing parts of an API.

With the latter, deletion, it’s inevitable that applications break. If a client is consuming the deleted resource, field, or structure, parts of their application will cease to function. The extent to which this really “breaks” the application can vary greatly, from having a minor cosmetic effect to making the application entirely unusable; regardless, deletion is still considered a breaking change.

Modification is less likely to break applications. Even if a client is using the resource, field, or endpoint that is modified, there’s a chance their application will continue to work as normal, depending on the implementation. For example, if a multimedia API goes from returning JPEGs to PNGs, applications that save those file types as well will most likely continue to work.

Of course, modification still carries a genuine risk of breaking client applications. Since the responsible API owner doesn’t leave these things to chance, modifications should also be treated as breaking changes.
Examples

Common examples of breaking changes include:

    Deleting a resource or method
    Deleting a response field
    Modifying a resource or method URI
    Modifying a field name
    Modifying required query parameters
    Modifying authorization
    Modifying rate-limiting
	
	
Best Practices for Breaking Changes
====================================
If you want to take the best possible care of your clients (and you should!), there are quite a few best practices you can adopt to avoid and mitigate breaking changes. Let’s start with how you can avoid them, since this is always preferable for developers:

    Test your code for accidental breaking changes. Breaking changes are particularly troublesome if you don’t know they’re there. Thankfully, there’s an easy solution for API owners that build against an OpenAPI specification: openapi-diff. This open-source tool compares two OpenAPI (v3) specifications and alerts you if any (obvious) breaking changes have been made.
    Future-proof your documentation. It might be cliché, but documentation really can help you avoid breaking changes — especially additive ones. For example, in the early stages of a platform, some objects may consist of just a few fields. If you know considerably more fields will be added in the future, you can instruct clients to expect this and build their applications against it.
    Carefully plan your API in advance. Once again, it might be obvious, but the importance of carefully planning your APIs cannot be understated. Even something as mundane as naming can result in breaking changes — or a persistently bad developer experience — if poorly planned.

Q:Q:What is the way to represent the resource in REST?
REST uses different representation to define the resources like text, JSON and XML. The most popular representation of resources is JSON and XML.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the characteristics of REST?
Here, are the two characteristics of REST.

REST is stateless. With the use of the REST API the server has no status, we can restart the server between two calls, inspite of all the data is transferred to the server.
Web Services uses POST method to perform operations, while REST uses GET method to access the resources.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is messaging in RESTFUL Web Services?
RESTFUL Web Services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server. This is the technique when the client sends a message in the form of HTTP request the server send back the HTTP reply which is called Messaging.

Q:Who writes the feature file -----------QA / Dev / BA 
Q:Advantages of cucumber ----It has feature file which uses english like language and anyone read this w/o having any code knowledge
Q:Can we put implicit and explicit all together in same script ------------ 
Ans : Not a good practice , script slow hp jaeygi 

Setting Explicit Wait is important in cases where there are certain elements that naturally take more time to load. If one sets an implicit wait command, then the browser will wait for the same time frame before loading every web element. This causes an unnecessary delay in executing the test script.

Explicit wait is more intelligent, but can only be applied for specified elements. However, it is an improvement on implicit wait since it allows the program to pause for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

There is an error at the line “super.super.print();”. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members. It is allowed in C++ though.




It can be done as 

// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {

Q:Q:Real example of Abstrction in sleenoum framework ?
Ans :
These concepts are commonly used in framework development. Abstract class is used in defining a common super class while writing Page Object Model layer of the framework. We usually create an abstract class named BasePage to have all common members for every page written in this class e.g getPageTitle().

Then each Page class (HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage etc.) inherit from BasePage. Sometimes one may need to change the behavior of methods implemented in superclass. So subclass has freedom to override that method where we use polymorphism. This is how we use Abstract class in real projects.

Q:******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q:Name some CI/CD tools .
Ans : Jenkins , Bamboo , Apache 
===============================================================================================================================================
DevOps --> It is formed with the combination of developer + operations(Jo code deploy karega) .They work together and deliver the deliverables more fastly , accurately and 
in less time 

The moment code is developed - it is pushed to repository using version control tool say git ----> further pushed to CI/CD tool say jenkins .Jenkins 
will test the functionality as soon as the new code is pushed .This complete cycle is CI .
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Advantages of agile ?
Ans :
1.Requirements are more understandable as you gets continuos feedback from client 
2.Delievry are done at quite faster rate - deliverying the deliverables in every sprint whihc happens every week or biweekenly 
===============================================================================================================================================
Devops bascially integrate the development with operations 
Dvelopment includes - Plan , code , build , test 

-------Intergrate using jenkins / Bamboo with below phases ---------
Deploy , operate , monitor  


This helps o make speedy and more perfectly and early feedaback can be expected using devops in agile .

If code fails after test (stage 4 ) then code is resent bak to dev , else ushe hum deploy kar dete hain (step 6).

Q:Properties of hashmap 
Lets say there is a hashmap , for which jis key ki hum value nikal rhe hain .Woh key exists he nahe karti to value kya hogi 

Ans :

2.Stores value in key-value pair 
3.Cannot have duplicate key
4.Agar jaise kisi ne multiple null values di hai aur woh at the time of extraction of value woh null key ko bulata hai 
say like 
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD");
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD11");

In the result --- tumhe error nahe milega but when you will do Hashmap.get(null)-- it will return value ABCD1



HashMap<String , String> capticalMap = new HashMap<String , String>();

capticalMap.put("India","New Delhi");
capticalMap.put("USA","Washington DC");
capticalMap.put("UK","London");


//Extracting value from map 

System.out.println(capticalMap.get("India"));

*******Q:Explain the statements and also tell what is the differnce between both 

double a = 100 ;
double a = (double) 100;

Ans :: In first case , we are assigning value to variable a as 100 and data type of a is double .So the value will be like 100.00 and size will be of 8 byte 

In second case , we are type casting the value .Basically 100 jo hai woh int value hai usko double mein convert karne ke liye we re doing this .Int ka size 4 byte hota hai after casting it to double it will be chnage to 8 byte 

*****Implicit and explicit / up & downcasting  yaha woh use ho rha hai .
Int -----> double (Up casting)

Q:Q:If in case agar aapko yeh nahe pta kitne argument spass karne hai kisi method mein , lets say aaj ek method hai say 
public void m1(String SS ) ----kal yeh method ko aap reuse karna chaho aur aap es mein 2 string ya 2 int aur pass karna chaho to
aur you want to use concept of reuse how can be done 

Ans - 1.Method Overloading jaise 
public void m1(String SS ) 
public void m2(String SS , Int a ) 


2nd Way ::
always declare argument like 

public void m1(Object.. Obj)=======>>==============>>

ab kya hai na Object.. declare karne se aap kitne bhe variables declare kar sakte ho , aur woh method ko kitni marji baar bula sakte ho  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the limits of API ?

Ans - 
Many Api has some limitations based on the provider , they try to understand what all type of data (jaise emirates flight ki api make my trip tya yatra use karti hai , to es case mein mmt ya yatra consumer hui and emirates providees).

Provider sochega ki data share karne se kitna mera data secure rhega , kya share karna hai aur kis limits mein 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Example of API 

Ans - Let says there is app say uber , now uber cabs requires some sort of map to run their cars .Uber will not go and create their map , they will use someones else api say google map or apple map .They will link their api's with google map api's and this is how it works in real world .

Another example is Yatra , MMT , Trivago all are using api from other companies / providers say : lemontree hotels , lalit hotels , JW marriot hotels and so on .In addtion they also uses api from other companies like ---> emirates , jetairway and so on
===============================================================================================================================================
Q; Who all can use API's ?

Ans - Any client whihc supports http methods - put , get , delete , post , put can use it .Even a mobile can use any api
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Advantages of API testing 

1.Intial level par he es backend testing se aap bugs find kar sakte ho , save lots of money and time 
2.Very quick and fast as compared to UI 
3.Cost effectve 
4.You can run plethora of API test in very short span of time 
5.very less maintance if scripts as no xpath change chances are there 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Api's Envioronment 

Ans - Stage/QA/Dev/Production
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Error code for authentication and Authorization

Ans 401

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. –

Ans - JSON, XML, HTML, text

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will you check first when a lot of failures in API automation?

Q:

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What al to test in API's ?
Ans 

1.Verify correct HTTP status code. For example, creating a resource should return 201 CREATED and unpermitted requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.

2. Verify response payload. Check valid JSON body and correct field names, types, and values — including in error responses.

3. Verify response headers. HTTP server headers have implications on both security and performance.

4. Verify correct application state. This is optional and applies mainly to manual testing, or when a UI or another interface can be easily inspected.  

5. Verify basic performance sanity. If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test fails.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which dependency is good to handle Json operations?

Ans -

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.googlecode.json-simple</groupId>  
    <artifactId>json-simple</artifactId>  
    <version>1.1</version>  
 </dependency>
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will be your action, when a mandatory header which is passed in all the services becomes optional?

Ams pehle woh gloval variable that , ab ushe hum env variable banna denge 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you write a sample of API(URL) and JSON?

            "id": "2"
        }
]
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you explain RequestSpecification request = RestAssured.given();

Ans -RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like. This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between digest and basic authentication ?

Ans Digest Authentication communicates credentials in an encrypted form by applying a hash function to: the username, the password, a server supplied nonce value, the HTTP method and the requested URI.

Whereas Basic Authentication uses non-encrypted base64 encoding.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How the bearer toekn can be passed in rest assured ?

Ans - Using oath2 

given().contentType(contentType.JSON).body().auth().oauth2("-------").when().get("---------------");

Response Res = given().contentType(contentType.JSON).auth().oauth1("","","","").when().post(---);
===============================================================================================================================================
When you login to a site say makemytrip , you can also login using google or facebook .In that case google/facebook will not pass all the information to the makemytrip site ,only
username and password is passed.

Q:********What is Name Space and its usage

Ans :  A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
consider a system of naming of people where each person has a given name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just "Jane" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the "global" namespace of all people, the full name must be used.

===============================================================================================================================================
:********what is Difference b/w Listiterator and Iterator

Q:What are hashmap and HashSet? Explain?
Ans: HashMap and HashSet both are one of the most important classes of Java Collection framework. … HashMap Stores elements in form of key-value pair i.e each element has its corresponding key which is required for its retrieval during iteration. HashSet stores only objects no such key value pairs maintained.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Where do you use a hashmap?
Ans: Maps are used for when you want to associate a key with a value and Lists are an ordered collection. Map is an interface in the Java Collection Framework and a HashMap is one implementation of the Map interface. HashMap are efficient for locating a value based on a key and inserting and deleting values based on a key. HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

// Add elements to the map
map.put(“vishal”, 10);
map.put(“sachin”, 30);
map.put(“vaibhav”, 20);

// Print size and content
System.out.println(“Size of map is:- ”
+ map.size());
System.out.println(map);

// Check if a key is present and if
// present, print value
if (map.containsKey(“vishal”)) {
Integer a = map.get(“vishal”);
System.out.println(“value for key” + ” \”vishal\” is:- ” + a);

Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides

===============================================================================================================================================

========================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q:2. Explain the review process you follow in your organization? 
A. The various phases of the review process followed in my organization are: 
Planning: >selecting the personal for review >allocating roles >defining entry and exit criteria. 
Kick-off: >Distributing documents >explaining the objectives >checking entry criteria, etc.
Individual preparation: > in the phase, each of the participants will work before the review meeting and be ready with questions and comments. 
Review Meeting: > Discussion among the review members by going through each line of the work product. > Logging comments > Making decision about the defect.
Rework: > Fixing defects found during the review, typically done by the author. 
Follow-up: > checking the defects that have been addressed. >gathering metrics and checking the exit criteria.

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides

Q:Union and UnionAll 

Ans : 
UNION :
The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.

To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have

The same number of columns selected
The same number of column expressions
The same data type and
Have them in the same order


UNION ALL :

The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements including duplicate rows.

The same rules that apply to the UNION clause will apply to the UNION ALL operator.

Q:Q:What is use of intern() method ?
Ans : The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap memory and stores it in the String constant pool. Note that, if another String with the same contents exists in the String constant pool, then a new object won't be created and the new reference will point to the other String.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why we cannot crate an object of abstract and interface ?
Ans : No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class because it does not have a complete implementation. 
The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses. It acts like a template, or an empty or partially empty structure, you should extend it and build on it before you can use it.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Q:What is collision in Hashmap ?
Ans : Collisions in the HashMap
A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.


collision resolution techniques comes into play only when multiple keys end up with the same hashcode (i.e., they fall in the same bucket location) where an entry is already stored. HashMap handles the collision resolution by using the concept of chaining i.e., it stores the values in a linked list 

chaining, i.e. they use linked list to store map entries which ended in the same bucket due to a collision. If a key end up in the same bucket location where entry is already stored then this entry is just added at the head of the linked list there.

===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Q:Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following is the disadvantage of statelessness in RESTful web services:-

Web services need to get extra information in each request and then interpret to get the client’s state in case client interactions are to be taken care of.

Answer: GET operations are read-only and are safe.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Why not forefox driver = new fireforx();

Ans : The FirefoxDriver instance which gets created based on above statement will be only able to invoke and act on the methods implemented by FirefoxDriver and supported by Firefox Browser only. We know that FirefoxDriver is a class and it implements all the methods of WebDriver interface. Using this statement, we can run our scripts only on Firefox Browser.
==========================================================================
Q:why not serachcontentdriver driver = new Firefoxdriver()?

kyn ki search cpntent ke pass 2 he methods hain findelement , findelements .however webdriver ke pass apne bhe kaey method hain , es liye we do webdriver driver = new firefoxdriver();
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q::Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Git ammend command ?

Ans : The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. 


--->git commit --amend
The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works basically the same way — first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Q:Clone() method ?

Ans:  The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object of a class which implements Cloneable interface. By default, it does field-by-field copy as the Object class doesn't have any idea about the members of the particular class whose objects call this method.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================

Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

Q:Union and UnionAll 

Ans : 
UNION :
The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.

To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have

The same number of columns selected
The same number of column expressions
The same data type and
Have them in the same order


UNION ALL :

The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements including duplicate rows.

The same rules that apply to the UNION clause will apply to the UNION ALL operator.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Examples of Abstract and Interface used in the selenium project

Ans-WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

In above line “WebDriver” is an interface which lists all the methods required to be present for Browser Interactions; irrespective of Browser type.

No how would all the Browser’s Driver namely, firefox, IE, Safari etc could ensure that they have all the required methods for Browser Interaction.

Now lets just say ChromeDriver team got a new method which they added in ChromeDriver class and user of selenium test thought of using that method.

Since, FirefoxDriver team did not add it, above test will fail for mozilla browser.

Only way to ensure that all the drivers (ChromeDriver, FireFox Driver) have same set of method and properties is by pointing them to a single source. A source which contains all the required methods for Browser Interaction.

===============================================================================================================================================
What is Encapsulation in Java?

🅰 The process of binding data and corresponding methods (behavior) together into a single unit is called encapsulation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Data hiding in Java? How to achieve it programmatically?

🅰 Data hiding is a technique by which we prevent to access data members (variables) directly from outside the class so that we can achieve security on data.

By declaring data members (variables) as private, we can achieve or implement data hiding.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What would happen if we do not use Encapsulation in a program?

🅰 If we don’t use encapsulation in a program, fields will not be private and could be accessed by anyone from outside the class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Which class in Java is super class of every other class?

🅰 Object class is the superclass of every other class in Java.

===============================================================================================================================================
How is Inheritance implemented/achieved in Java?

🅰 Inheritance can be implemented or achieved by using two keywords:

extends: extends is a keyword that is used for developing the inheritance between two classes and two interfaces.

implements: implements keyword is used for developing the inheritance between a class and interface.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is it possible to use this() and super() both in same constructor?

🅰 No, Java does not allow using both super() and this() together in same constructor. As per Java specification, super() or this() must be the first statement in a constructor.


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is type conversion in Java?

🅰 The process of converting a value from one data type to another is known as type conversion.

===============================================================================================================================================
What is class casting in Java?

🅰 The process of converting a class type into another class type having relationship between them through inheritance is called class casting.

===============================================================================================================================================
31. What is upcasting and downcasting in Java?

🅰 When the reference variable of super class refers to the object of sub class, it is known as upcasting.

When subclass reference refers to super class object, it is called downcasting.

===============================================================================================================================================
Can we stop method overriding in Java?

🅰 Yes, we can stop method overriding by declaring method as final.

===============================================================================================================================================
39. What is the use of method overriding?

🅰 Method overriding is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It is used to change the existing functionality of the superclass method.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?

🅰 Yes, we can override an overloaded method in Java.
===============================================================================================================================================
 How to achieve or implement abstraction in Java?

🅰 There are two ways by which we can achieve abstraction in java. They are:

    Abstract class (0 to 100%)
    Interface (100%)
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we create an object of abstract class in Java?

🅰 No, we cannot create an instance of abstract class in Java. This is because abstract class is not a concrete class. If you try to instantiate, you will get compile 
===============================================================================================================================================
When to use abstract class and abstract method in Java?

🅰 An abstract method is generally used when the same method has to perform different tasks depending on the object calling it.

An abstract class is used when we need to share the same method to all non-abstract subclasses with their own specific implementations.

===============================================================================================================================================
*************Why abstract class has constructor even though you cannot create object?

🅰 We cannot create an object of abstract class but we can create an object of subclass of abstract class. When we create an object of subclass of an abstract class, it calls the constructor of subclass.

This subclass constructor has super in the first line that calls constructor of an abstract class. Thus, the constructors of an abstract class are used from constructor of its subclass.

If the abstract class doesn’t have constructor, a class that extends that abstract class will not get compiled.

===============================================================================================================================================
Can a class be declared as final in Java?

🅰 Yes, a class can be declared as final in Java. Once a class is declared final, it cannot be extended.
===============================================================================================================================================
What is blank final variable? Can we initialize the blank final variable?

🅰 A variable that is declared as final and not initialized at a time of declaration is known as a blank final variable.

Yes, if it is non-static then we can declare in the constructor. If it is static blank final variable, it can be initialized only in the static block.
===============================================================================================================================================
***************Which class is the most common predefined final class object in Java?

🅰 String class
===============================================================================================================================================
Can a class be declared as static?

🅰 No, a class cannot be marked as static but an inner class can be static.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is it allowed to change the value of static variable in Java?

🅰 Yes, we can change the value of the static variable by using a constructor, or static block but not inside a static method.
===============================================================================================================================================
*****Can we use this or super keyword in static method in Java?

🅰 In entire core java, this and super keyword is not allowed inside the static method or static area.

===============================================================================================================================================
What is the use of static block in Java?

🅰 The purpose of using a static block is to write that logic inside static block that is executed during the class loading. It is also used for changing the default value of static variable.

===============================================================================================================================================
*****What is the use private constructor in Java?

🅰 Private constructor is used to preventing other classes from accessing objects of a class. It can be also used in single tone classes where the object of the class cannot be created outside the class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Can a constructor be final?

🅰 Not, a constructor cannot be final.

===============================================================================================================================================
What is constructor chaining in Java?

🅰 Constructor chaining is a technique of calling one constructor from another constructor using this and super keyword. The keyword “this” is used to call a constructor from another constructor within the same class whereas, keyword “super” is used to call parent (super) class constructor from child (subclass) class constructor. It occurs through inheritance.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between argument and parameter in Java?

🅰 A parameter is a variable in the definition of a method whereas an argument is an actual value of this variable that is passed to the method’s parameter.

===============================================================================================================================================
What will happen if we make a constructor of class private?

🅰 If we make any constructor as a private, we cannot create the object of that class from another class and also cannot create the subclass of that class.

106. Can we create an object of class if we make a constructor protected?

🅰 Yes, if we make constructor as protected then we can create the subclass of that class within the same package but not outside the package.

17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q: Colour Code 


Ans - 
RGB Value
In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

Experiment by mixing the RGB values below:

*****************************************************element.getCssValue("color")*********************************

31. Git commands.. diff between stash and stage. How to create branch.
Stash will move your modified files into a stack. So, later in the same or in another branch, you will be able to bring them back and see those modifications in your project. Stage is the step before to make a commit, you add modified files to "Staged files" to create your next commit.

===============================================================================================================================================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
HashSet doesn't allow duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate element in HashSet, the old value would be overwritten
HashMap doesn't allow duplicate keys but allows duplicate values. That means A single key can't contain more than 1 value but more than 1 key can contain a single value. HashMap allows null key also but only once and multiple null values
===============================================================================================================================================
What is saop and rest api?
Soap uses -- wdsl file which dev provides , while Rest Api's uses URI (whihc dev provides )
WDLS is a heavy file , URIl is light and each function will have a seperate URI.

SOAP defines its own security where as REST inherits security from the underlying transport.

SOAP does not support error handling, but REST has built-in error handling.

Q:Auto It use ?
Sometimes selenium is helpless to handle the window related stuff , as when you click on some download option lets say a pdf file , you can view it in browser , however download nahe ho pati windows mein 

us cheez ke liye we use Auto it 

1.Install the Auto it in your machine 
2.After installation it will go to c:/program(x86)/autoit
3.There is a file - Au3Info_x64 - which is basically a finder 
4.Scite is a file which is a editior 

--Commands : controlfocus , controlsetTest,ControlClick(These two be used in AutoIt)

Note : InetGet is used in Auto it to Downloads a file from the internet using the HTTP, HTTPS or FTP protocol.

Run auto it script in selenium
Runtime.getRuntime().exe

Q:Difference git pull and git fetch ?

git fetch pulls latest changes done by other devs from remote reporsiroty to local repo and then you have to run merge command to merge the changes in your local

git pull -Download and merges the changes in your local.
===============================================================================================================================================
Collections: HashMap-----key and value. If we have states and cities, which will be the key ?
HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you make the constructor of a class static?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java, If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur. In general, static means class level.
===============================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================
Q:How ot automate get and post request 

Ans we can store/manage the json data in 3 forms 
--json file 
--org.json librarg 
--pojo class 

using file , filereader , JSONTokener JSONObject you can call the data from json file 

Response res = given().ContentType(ContentType.JSON).body().when().Post("");

Using JSON File 

//////////////////////Extracting the Single Order ////////////////////////
		
		JSONObject object1 = new JSONObject(Res.asPrettyString());
		int size = object1.length();
		System.out.println("Size of Objects is " + size);

		System.out.println("Complete Data Extracted from response is "  + object1.toString());
		
		String Salary_Employee_FirstRecord = Res.jsonPath().getString("employee[0].salary");
		System.out.println("Gender from firstRecord of Employee  is " + Salary_Employee_FirstRecord );
		
		
		String contractFrom = Res.jsonPath().getString("contractors[0].contractFrom");
		System.out.println("Contract from firstRecord of Employee  is " + contractFrom );
		
		String companyHOCity = Res.jsonPath().getString("companyHOCity");
		System.out.println("Company HO City  from firstRecord of Employee  is " + companyHOCity );

Q:Explain API testing and how can we achieve it?

Ans -->
Base + End point + parameter 

Query paramters -------------------->  when there is a question mark(?) this is query parameter 
Path parameter --------------------------> when there is a / -- this is query parameter 

See example 
Varible			IntialValue 					CurrentValue (yeh apne aap pick karega)
Base			http://localhost:3000			http://localhost:3000
EndPoint		APIBatch						APIBatch

Get address pehle tha ---http://localhost:3000/APIBatch
Now it became 			{{Base}}/{{EndPoint}}


Firstly it will check inside the env variables - if there will  be value then it will pick that valuse else it will look into global variables 

Whatever is same -- always keep it in global variables 
whatever is changed for all environments ---make it as environmental variable 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between Class and Structure?

Ans - A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a class combines the fields and methods(member function which defines actions) into a single unit.

A structure is a collection of variables of different data types under a single unit. It is almost similar to a class because both are user-defined data types and both hold a bunch of different data types.
===============================================================================================================================================
Difference between Stack and Heap memory?
In a stack, the allocation and de-allocation are automatically done by the compiler whereas in heap, it needs to be done by the programmer manually.

Handling of Heap frame is costlier than the handling of the stack frame.
Memory shortage problem is more likely to happen in stack whereas the main issue in heap memory is fragmentation.


Stack frame access is easier than the heap frame as the stack have a small region of memory and is cache-friendly, but in case of heap frames which are dispersed throughout the memory so it causes more cache misses.

Q:1) What is multithreading?
Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. Multithreading is used to obtain the multitasking. It consumes less memory and gives the fast and efficient performance. Its main advantages are:

Threads share the same address space.
The thread is lightweight.
The cost of communication between the processes is low.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:118. Can an Interface be defined in a Class?
Ans -
Yes, you can define an interface inside a class and it is known as a nested interface. You can't access a nested interface directly; you need to access (implement) the nested interface using the inner class or by using the name of the class holding this nested interface.

===============================================================================================================================================
1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.
===============================================================================================================================================
140.Can we re-throw an Exception in Java?

Ans -
When an exception is cached in a catch block, you can re-throw it using the throw keyword (which is used to throw the exception objects).

Ex1 - 
try {
   int result = (arr[a])/(arr[b]);
   System.out.println("Result of "+arr[a]+"/"+arr[b]+": "+result);
}
catch(ArithmeticException e) {
   throw e;
}


Ex 2 -
try {
   int result = (arr[a])/(arr[b]);
   System.out.println("Result of "+arr[a]+"/"+arr[b]+": "+result);
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
   throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
}

Question: How is Webdriver beneficial over Selenium Server?
Answer: Webdriver does not require the Selenium Server because it uses a completely different technology. It provides Selenium RC functionality, which provides backward compatibility to Selenium 1.0. Also, it makes a direct call to the various browsers for making automation. At the same time, in the case of Selenium RC, it requires the Selenium Server to input the Javascript into the browser.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Define Vector in collections ?

Ans - Vector implements a dynamic array that means it can grow or shrink as required. 
Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index
They are very similar to ArrayList but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy method that the collection framework does not contain.
It also maintains an insertion order like an ArrayList 


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector are all implementations of the List interface. Which of them is most efficient for adding and removing elements from the list? Explain your answer, including any other alternatives you may be aware of.

Ans 

Out Of the three, LinkedList is generally going to give you the best performance. Here’s why:

ArrayList and Vector each use an array to store the elements of the list. As a result, when an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly. Vector is synchronized, so if a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList rather than Vector.

LinkedList, on the other hand, is implemented using a doubly linked list. As a result, an inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed.

However, it is worth noting that if performance is that critical, it’s better to just use an array and manage it yourself, or use one of the high performance 3rd party packages such as Trove or HPPC.

===============================================================================================================================================
*********Q:Why would it be more secure to store sensitive data (such as a password, social security number, etc.) in a character array rather than in a String?

Ans - In Java, Strings are immutable and are stored in the String pool. What this means is that, once a String is created, it stays in the pool in memory until being garbage collected. Therefore, even after you’re done processing the string value (e.g., the password), it remains available in memory for an indeterminate period of time thereafter (again, until being garbage collected) which you have no real control over. Therefore, anyone having access to a memory dump can potentially extract the sensitive data and exploit it.

In contrast, if you use a mutable object like a character array, for example, to store the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it with confidence that it will no longer be retained in memory.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Compare the sleep() and wait() methods in Java, including when and why you would use one vs. the other.

Ans -sleep() is a blocking operation that keeps a hold on the monitor / lock of the shared object for the specified number of milliseconds.

wait(), on the other hand, simply pauses the thread until either (a) the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed or (b) it receives a desired notification from another thread (whichever is first), without keeping a hold on the monitor/lock of the shared object.

sleep() is most commonly used for polling, or to check for certain results, at a regular interval. wait() is generally used in multithreaded applications, in conjunction with notify() / notifyAll(), to achieve synchronization and avoid race conditions.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you swap the values of two numeric variables without using any other variables?

Ams 
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are static initializers and when would you use them?

Ans - A static initializer gives you the opportunity to run code during the initial loading of a class and it guarantees that this code will only run once and will finish running before your class can be accessed in any way.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:*****What is the difference between String s = "Test" and String s = new String("Test")? Which is better and why?

Ans -
In general, String s = "Test" is more efficient to use than String s = new String("Test").

In the case of String s = "Test", a String with the value “Test” will be created in the String pool. If another String with the same value is then created (e.g., String s2 = "Test"), it will reference this same object in the String pool.

However, if you use String s = new String("Test"), in addition to creating a String with the value “Test” in the String pool, that String object will then be passed to the constructor of the String Object (i.e., new String("Test")) and will create another String object (not in the String pool) with that value. Each such call will therefore create an additional String object (e.g., String s2 = new String("Test") would create an addition String object, rather than just reusing the same String object from the String pool).
===============================================================================================================================================
11. What is the difference between type keys and type commands?

Ans -TypeKeys() will trigger JavaScript events, while type() won’t. TypesKeys collects different value attributes using JavaScript. Whereas, the type commands imitate an actual user typing.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What is an exception test in Selenium?

Ans - An exception test is a test that looks forward to an exception to be thrown inside a test class. It anticipates the @Test annotation followed by the expected exception name. For example, @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class) is an exception test for missing elements in Selenium.

Note: Keep in mind the syntax, where the exception is suffixed with .class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How will you use Selenium to upload a file?

Ans - If the file is on the same machine or in a mapped network drive, it is really straightforward: We have to just type the ‘path’ of the file in the FileUpload control.

Example:

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
element = driver.find_element_by_id("fileUpload")
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")
===============================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you identify an object in Selenium?
Ans -We can use isElementPresent (string locator) to find an object in Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and, if found, returns a Boolean.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is it possible to call one constructor from another in Java?

Ans: Yes, but one can only chain to one constructor — and it has to be the first statement in your constructor body.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is reflection and why is it useful?

Ans: Reflection is used to describe code that is able to inspect other code in the same system

        String str3 = "Reader";  
        // Concatenating one string   
        String str4 = str1.concat(str2);          
        System.out.println(str4);  
        // Concatenating multiple strings  
        String str5 = str1.concat(str2).concat(str3);  
        System.out.println(str5);  
    }  
}  
===============================================================================================================================================
Question: Can a class be private?
Answer: Only nested or inner classes can be private because they can be accessed by the outer class. A normal class cannot be final because you can not instantiate it (create object).

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

===============================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object 
===============================================================================================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:can we use the same code in catch block ?
Only error prone code is within the try block and the handling of that error is written in the catch block..Catch block is use to handle run time exception ?

Q:Can we throw an exception manually?

If yes, how?Yes, we can throw an exception manually using throw keyword. Syntax for throwing an exception manually isthrow InstanceOfThrowableType

Throwing exceptions manually
You can throw a user defined exception or, a predefined exception explicitly using the throw keyword.

There are two types of exceptions user defined and predefined each exception is represented by a class and which inherits the Throwable class.

To throw an exception explicitly you need to instantiate the class of it and throw its object using the throw keyword.

public class ExceptionExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
      NullPointerException nullPointer = new NullPointerException();
      throw nullPointer;
   }
}


Whenever you throw an exception explicitly you need to make sure that the line with throw keyword is the last line of the program. This is because any code written after it is unreachable code and if you still have code snippets below this line a compile time error will be generated.



Example 2


class ThrowExcep
{
    static void fun()
    {
        try
        {
            throw new NullPointerException("demo");
        }
        catch(NullPointerException e)
        {
            System.out.println("Caught inside fun().");
            throw e; // rethrowing the exception
        }
    }

Q: When to use  concat and when to use plus in strings ?


public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s = "Gfg";
        s = s.concat("! is the best.");
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.

-----
public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s1 = "Gfg";
        String s2 = "! is the best";
  
        String s3 = s1 + s2;
  
        System.out.println(s3);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.



---------->Number of arguments the concat() method and + operator takes: <------------------

concat() method takes only one argument of string and concat it with other string.

+ operator takes any number of arguments and concatenates all the strings.


public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String s = "Geeks", t = "for", g = "geeks";
  
        System.out.println(s + t + g);
        System.out.println(s.concat(t));
    }
}

Output :
Geeksforgeeks
Geeksfor


---------------<Performance<----------------------
concat() method is better than + operator because it creates a new object only when the string length is greater than zero(0) but + operator always a creates a new string irrespective of length of string.

Q:Difference in Automation testing/Tester and SDET (Software Design Engineer in test)
Automation Testing can be referred to role/designation as well as it is the term use to differentiate between Manual Testing and Automation Testing. You can say that I am in Automation Testing, I am Automation Tester, I am a Test Developer,Test Automation proffessional etc. But yes when it comes to the term SDET(Software Development/Design Engineer in Test) This refers to a role which has expertise in below aspects of Automation Testing (not mandatorily all but most of it):

Automation Framework Designing-Selenium, Cucumber, Siquili, AutoIT, RPM, Rest-Assured API, OK HTTP, etc

Coding/Scripting (Java,C#, Python, Pearl, Ruby etc)

CICD pipeline (continuous Integration Continuous Development/Delivery)- Jenkins, Maven,Bamboo etc. DevOps tools and practices -GitHub, Ansible, Docker etc.

Apart from all above, SDET must also be aware of QA practices, Like Agile, Waterfall, STLC SDLC, defect lifecycle, Diff Types of Testings, Testing situational dealings, Test Plan and artifacts etc.
==================================================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Ques.28. Explain the different types of specification based test design technique?
Ans. Specification based test design techniques are also referred to as blackbox testing. It involves testing based on the specification of the system under test without knowing its internal architecture. The different types of specification based test design or black box testing techniques are-

    Equivalence partitioning - Grouping test data into logical groups or equivalence classes with the assumpation that all the data items lying in the classes will     have same effect on the application.
    Boundary value analysis - Testing using the boundary values of the equivalence classes taken as the test input.
    Decision tables - Testing using decision tables showing application's behaviour based on different combination of input values.
    Cause-effect graph - Testing using graphical representation of input i.e. cause and output i.e. effect is used for test designing.
    State transition testing - Testing based on state machine model.
    Use case testing - Testing carried out using use cases.user action and system response.


Ques.34. What is use case testing?
Ans. A use case testing is a black box testing approach in which testing is carried out using use cases. A use case scenario is seen as interaction between the application and actors(users).



Ques.41). What are the different types of Integration testing?
Ans. The different type of integration testing are-

    Big bang Integration Testing - In big bang integration testing, testing starts only after all the modules are integrated.
    Top-down Integration Testing - In top down integration, testing/integration starts from top modules to lower level modules.
    Bottom-up Integration Testing - In bottom up integration, testing starts from lower level modules to higher level module up in the heirarchy.
    Hybrid Integration Testing - Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom up integration testing. In this approach, the integration         starts from middle layer and testing is carried out in both the direction

Q: What is Authentication / Autherization ?

Ans - 
Authentication / Authorization 

Authorization - user has rights or not 



for example 
ek hamari application hai ----aur ek outer application hai say Indigo ya british airlines --ab british airlines ya indogo ne apni API's expose ki hui hai so that koi bhe use kar sake , jaise hum (MMT ) hain we can also use the exposed api of indigo or british airlines 


Ab Britsh auirlines ya indogo ki api's hum directly use nahe kar sake , we should have the rights to consume it .


Types of Authentication ::

---- Basic authentication --------- username and password 
---- oAuth Authentication ----> you need to pass -----> Consumer Key , Consumer Secret ,Access Token ,Token Secret
---- Token Id / Bearer Token --- Ek API hit karke -> token id milegi --> you have to use it in API-Application ---here we need to pass the token in the postman_collection
---- oAuth2 ----> Only token need to be passed 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Authentication examples 


Always go to offcial document like jira api documentation 

Example of basic Authentication ::::

  .then()
  .assertThat()
  .statusCode(HttpStatus.OK.value());

Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?
Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): An XML-based method to expose web services.

REST (Representational State Transfer): Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the most popular way to represent a resource in REST?

REST uses different representations to define a resource like text, JSON, and XML.
XML and JSON are the most popular representations of resources.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which protocol is used by RESTful Web services?

RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between the client and the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
What are the core components of an HTTP request?
An HTTP request contains five key elements:

An action showing HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is the identifier for the resource on the server.
HTTP Version, which indicates HTTP version, for example-HTTP v1.1.
Request Header, which carries metadata (as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message. Metadata could be a client (or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of a message body format, cache settings, and so on.
Request Body, which indicates the message content or resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is there any difference between PUT and POST operations?

Q: Difference between PUT and Patch
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the upper limit for a payload to pass in the POST method?

Ans -So, theoretically, a user can pass unlimited data as the payload to POST method. But, if we consider a real use case, then sending POST with large payload will consume more bandwidth. It’ll take more time and present performance challenges to your server. Hence, a user should take action accordingly.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain what is REST and RESTFUL?

REST represents REpresentational State Transfer; it is a relatively new aspect of writing web API.

RESTFUL is referred for web services written by applying REST architectural concept are called RESTful services, it focuses on system resources and how state of resource should be transported over HTTP protocol to different clients written in different language. In RESTFUL web service HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE can be used to perform CRUD operations.

===============================================================================================================================================
****Explain the architectural style for creating web API?

The architectural style for creating web api are

HTTP for client server communication
XML/JSON as formatting language
Simple URI as the address for the services
Stateless communication

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Mention some key characteristics of REST?

Some key characteristics of REST includes

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ention which markup language can be used in restful web api?

JSON and XML are the two markup language that can be used in restful web api
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the template available to send and receive data thru API

Post -> given().contentType(contenttype.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(URI);

Get --->given().contentType(contenttype.JSON).when().get(URI);
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How will you handle server issues in API testing both in postman and rest assured.. like 5xx.. explain

Ans - Causes 
1.Proxy issues 
2.Server Down / Unavailable /wrong server approached 


Check the backend server and secondly try to hit the service after sometime 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What’s the diff between Rest vs SOAP

Rest uses URI , Soap uses WDSL file 
Rest has capability to handle exceptions , soap dnt have 
Rest uses json/xml, soap uses xml
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the different ways you validate the rest of API response

In postman under test tab -> you can check the status by using chai assertions 
Also do validations for header and header content

Q:Explain your Rest Assured automation framework? 

Ans 
com.Resources -------------------------- JSON file , file will have extension .JSON
com.utility   -------------------------- PropertyFileReader , JSONFileReader
com.TestSuite -------------------------- HTTPMethods 
com.Testcases -------------------------- TestCases which will call HTTPMethods
URI.properties File -------------------- This will have Key:Value , example :: QA_URI:https://localhost:8080

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Differenve between regular calls vs OAuth calls

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:many ways in which an API can be not fully functional. These include:

Invalid response codes
Invalid response headers
API time-outs
Slow API response with respect to response data bytes
Incorrect required data in JSON responses
Missing required text in response bodies
Slow response for customers in specific locations

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What to validate in API 

Ans - Verify correct HTTP status code
 Verify response payload.
  Verify response headers.
  Verify basic performance sanity. If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test fails.

Test the API with valid body data and valid URI 
Test it with invalid URI , invalid body 
Do both positve and negative testing
Validatr the APi with couple of query parameters 
Do destructive testing - like passing the data with more characters as it accept 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to automate the testcase in postman w/o even opening the postman

==================================================Interview Question on API Naveen =============================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: API ?

Application progm interface , which helps to interact 2 diff applications or allows interface between DB & UI .You pass a body and in return you get the status/response to that .

Companies like twitter ,ola , uber , amazon all are using api's of some company 


API helps to perform function as well as non functional testing .Non Func like reliablity  ,performance and security (taki koi hacker na hack kar le).

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the limits of API ?

Ans - 
Many Api has some limitations based on the provider , they try to understand what all type of data (jaise emirates flight ki api make my trip tya yatra use karti hai , to es case mein mmt ya yatra consumer hui and emirates providees).

Provider sochega ki data share karne se kitna mera data secure rhega , kya share karna hai aur kis limits mein 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Example of API 

Ans - Let says there is app say uber , now uber cabs requires some sort of map to run their cars .Uber will not go and create their map , they will use someones else api say google map or apple map .They will link their api's with google map api's and this is how it works in real world .

Another example is Yatra , MMT , Trivago all are using api from other companies / providers say : lemontree hotels , lalit hotels , JW marriot hotels and so on .In addtion they also uses api from other companies like ---> emirates , jetairway and so on
===============================================================================================================================================
Q; Who all can use API's ?

Ans - Any client whihc supports http methods - put , get , delete , post , put can use it .Even a mobile can use any api
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Advantages of API testing 

1.Intial level par he es backend testing se aap bugs find kar sakte ho , save lots of money and time 
2.Very quick and fast as compared to UI 
3.Cost effectve 
4.You can run plethora of API test in very short span of time 
5.very less maintance if scripts as no xpath change chances are there 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Api's Envioronment 

Ans - Stage/QA/Dev/Production
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Error code for authentication and Authorization

Ans 401

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. –

Ans - JSON, XML, HTML, text

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will you check first when a lot of failures in API automation?

Q:

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What al to test in API's ?
Ans 

1.Verify correct HTTP status code. For example, creating a resource should return 201 CREATED and unpermitted requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.

2. Verify response payload. Check valid JSON body and correct field names, types, and values — including in error responses.

3. Verify response headers. HTTP server headers have implications on both security and performance.

4. Verify correct application state. This is optional and applies mainly to manual testing, or when a UI or another interface can be easily inspected.  

5. Verify basic performance sanity. If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test fails.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which dependency is good to handle Json operations?

Ans -

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.googlecode.json-simple</groupId>  
    <artifactId>json-simple</artifactId>  
    <version>1.1</version>  
 </dependency>
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will be your action, when a mandatory header which is passed in all the services becomes optional?

Ams pehle woh gloval variable that , ab ushe hum env variable banna denge 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you write a sample of API(URL) and JSON?

Ans - [
        {
            "FirstName": "Nipun",
            "LastName": "Verma",
            "BirthMonth": "Sep",

            "id": "2"
        }
]
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you explain RequestSpecification request = RestAssured.given();

Ans -RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like. This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between digest and basic authentication ?

Ans Digest Authentication communicates credentials in an encrypted form by applying a hash function to: the username, the password, a server supplied nonce value, the HTTP method and the requested URI.

Whereas Basic Authentication uses non-encrypted base64 encoding.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How the bearer toekn can be passed in rest assured ?

Q:********What is Name Space and its usage

Ans :  A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
consider a system of naming of people where each person has a given name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just "Jane" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the "global" namespace of all people, the full name must be used.

Q:What are hashmap and HashSet? Explain?
Ans: HashMap and HashSet both are one of the most important classes of Java Collection framework. … HashMap Stores elements in form of key-value pair i.e each element has its corresponding key which is required for its retrieval during iteration. HashSet stores only objects no such key value pairs maintained.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Where do you use a hashmap?
Ans: Maps are used for when you want to associate a key with a value and Lists are an ordered collection. Map is an interface in the Java Collection Framework and a HashMap is one implementation of the Map interface. HashMap are efficient for locating a value based on a key and inserting and deleting values based on a key. HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

// Add elements to the map
map.put(“vishal”, 10);
map.put(“sachin”, 30);
map.put(“vaibhav”, 20);

// Print size and content
System.out.println(“Size of map is:- ”
+ map.size());
System.out.println(map);

// Check if a key is present and if
// present, print value
if (map.containsKey(“vishal”)) {
Integer a = map.get(“vishal”);
System.out.println(“value for key” + ” \”vishal\” is:- ” + a);

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.

Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

Q:Explain how hashmap works ?
Ans - HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. It implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value. HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class. It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields in HashMap.

It is the process of converting an object into an integer value. The integer value helps in indexing and faster searches.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Difference in Iterator and List<Iterator>?
Ans - Iterator :
1.Can move in forward direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
2.Cannot add or remove element

List<Iterator> :
1.Can move in forward and reverse  direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward and Reverse direction.
2.Can add or remove element

Q:Can constructor be private?
Ans -Yes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:what is Iterator in java?

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Make a collection
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");

    // Get the iterator
    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();

    // Print the first item
    System.out.println(it.next());
  }
}
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How To Set The Priority Of Cucumber Hooks?
Ans 
@Before(order = int): This runs in increment order, means value 0 would run first and 1 would be after 0
@After(order = int): This runs in decrements order, which means the opposite of @Before. Value 1 would run first and 0 would be after 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:--Suppose ther are 100 scamerios and using hooks i want to run it for 5 only .How this can be possible ?

import cucumber.api.java.After;
import cucumber.api.java.Before;
 
public class Hooks {
 
 @Before
    public void beforeScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run before the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @After
    public void afterScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run after the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @Before("@First")
    public void beforeFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the First Scenario");
    } 
 
 @Before("@Second")
    public void beforeSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the Second Scenario");
    } 
 
 
 @After("@First")
    public void afterFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the First Scenario");   
    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.


===Note ::
We can also indicate if we want before and after hooks to be executed with a specific tag only. Example − @Before(‘@Web’). The same concept of tag logical and/or can be applied with hooks as well. Example − @Before(@dev,@wip), @Before(@dev,~@wip)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.
------------------------------------------------API Questions------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Challanges faced in API testing ?
Ans : 1.Documentation - we need lot of documents like api , endpoints , URI , authentication keys , headers 
2.Access to DB - you hit a URI -> get response , how to validate response is as per expectation or not .specially jab api 3rd party ki ho , us case mein
we dnt have their server access .
3.Authentication --> dekhna padega kaise token milega , search karna padega 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:List out authentication techniques ?

OAuth1 --Consumerkey , secretKey , --, --
OAuth2--token
Digest--usernanme and Password.But in encrypted form

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Why API is the best way to automate the things 
Ans -1.Lighter 
2.No need to update scripts as used to in case of UI , as xpath nahe hota koi
3.Early response 
4.Cost Effective 
5.Early stage par he user comes to know if the things working fine or not
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Rest API.
Ans - Set of functions/ API's where user sends a request and gets the response in return . Based on the response code we can come to knwo if the api is 
working fine or not .
It can act between 2 differnt platforms , mobile & web , 2 differnt languages 

Verfication to be done ::
1.Response code 
2.Response Time 
3.Header / Body 
4.Security - checking the authentication 
5.Errors if any

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:How do you represent a resource in rest?
Ans : Using HTTP method

Q:Q:: Can we test APIs or web services using Selenium webdriver?
No selenium webdriver uses browser's native method to automate the web applications. Since web services are headless, so we cannot automate web services using selenium webdriver.
==============================================================================
Q:Q:Name the superclass in Java.
Java.lang. All different non-primitive are inherited directly or indirectly from this class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 
===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

Q:53. Is it possible to achieve Runtime Polymorphism by data members in
Java?
Ans-A method is overridden, not the data members, so runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:62. Is it allowed to mark an interface method as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What environment variables do I need to set on my machine in order to be able to run Java programs?

CLASSPATH and PATH are the two variables.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is forbidden error?
The 403 Forbidden error is an HTTP status code which means that accessing the page or resource you were trying to reach is absolutely forbidden for some reason.
Rwasons :
An empty website directory
No index page
Permission / Ownership error
===============================================================================
What is 503 status code?
503 Service Unavailable. The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server

Q:===============================================================================
Q:Differnce in findBy , findBys and FindAll

@FindBys : When the required WebElement objects need to match all of the given criteria use @FindBys annotation

@FindAll : When required WebElement objects need to match at least one of the given criteria use @FindAll annotation

Usage:

@FindBys( {
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
} )
private List<WebElement> elementsWithBoth_class1ANDclass2;
Here List elementsWithBothclass1ANDclass2 will contain any WebElement which satisfies both criteria.

@FindAll({
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
})
private List<WebElement> elementsWithEither_class1ORclass2  
Here List elementsWithEither_class1ORclass2 will contain all those WebElement that satisfies any one of the criteria.

Q:Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
==============================================================================================================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?
Since an array is static in nature i.e. you cannot change the size of an array once created, So, if you need an array which can resize itself then you should use the ArrayList.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

Q:What si resource in API ?
Ans : Resource can be test file , html , image , server , service , video 

Resouces can be identified by URI
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is stalelessness in rest API ?
Ans : Ideally in API , it should not keep a client state on server this restriction is called statelessness.
Staless means each request goes as a seperate trasaction , it doesnot retain the previous trasaction

Http is stateless transaction , it doesnot allows server to save the previous transaction
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is accept and content type in Http
Ans - Accept tells webservices what kind of response client is acceptins .jaise webservices is capable of sending xml/json format then accpt header as application/xml then xml response will be sent

 content type- tells what type/ format of data is sent in the request .if content type of data is application/xml then server will parse the data into xml.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is swagger ?
Ans - Swagger is library which has differnt document 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Mention some key characteristics of REST?

Some key characteristics of REST includes

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ention which markup language can be used in restful web api?

JSON and XML are the two markup language that can be used in restful web api
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the different ways you validate the rest of API response

Q:Q: Type of basic authentication 

Basic auth- Preemptive and challanged 


Preemptive - way to send authentication , automatically send the credentials in form of header - whether server needs authentication or not it will send theauthentication in header 


given().contentTye(contentType.JSON).auth().preemptive().basic("username" , "Password").when()---


challanged - Here when server ask then only it will pass the credentials , here we are making two request in one we are sending header and in second we re sending credentials 

given().contentTye(contentType.JSON).auth().basic("username" , "Password").when()---

$.store.book[0]------------yeh book array ka pehle record display karega 
$.store.book[*]------------display all the array values jo book ke under hai , chahe us mein 5 objects ho ya kuch bhe 
$.store.book[*].title------------display all the title  values jo book ke under hai , chahe us mein 5 objects ho ya kuch bhe 
$.store..title ------------------ here .. (recirsion patter)-- displays all the title in the json under store 


Suppose strore ke under book array hai , and book array mein 3 objects hain ,you want to display all the records of that book array do 

$.store.book[*]

if you want to display one first record of the book do 

$.store.book[1]

agar pehle 2 records display karne ho to book array mein se .........>>>>>

$.store.book[0,1]-----------------------> vvvvimp ----> yeh pehle 2 he records display karega 


if you want to have category out of above two books , do it as 
$.store.book[0,1].category



if i want to display all the books data , do like
$..book


if you want to display in thw range say 1,2 ,3,4,5 record karna hai out of 10 record use :
$.store.book[0:4]

Q:Diff between URL and URI ?

URL -URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is often defined as a string of characters that is directed to an address. It is a very commonly used way to locate resources on the web. URL is a type of URI.

URI -URI is the superset of URL.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Hybrid Framework?
Hybrid Driven Framework is a mix of both the Data-Driven and Keyword Driven frameworks.

In this case, the keywords as well as the test data, are externalized. Keywords are stored in a separate Java class file and test data can be maintained in a Properties file or an Excel file.

===============================================================================================================================================

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?
WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

Q:Api vs WebServices 

Ans : 
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Trobleshooting in API?

Ans 
Is the URL correct?
Is the API key valid? - Each user has a unique key.
Is the authorization header valid?
Are the request parameters valid?
Did the API call return the expected results?
Did the API call return the expected results with expected performance 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Auth vs autherization 

Ans 
Authentication is when an entity proves an identity. In other words, Authentication proves that you are who you say you are. This is like having a driver license which is given by a trusted authority that the requester, such as a police officer, can use as evidence that suggests you are in fact who you say you are.

Authorization is an entirely different concept and in simple terms, Authorization is when an entity proves a right to access. In other words, Authorization proves you have the right to make a request. Consider the following - You have a working key card that allows you to open only some doors in the work area, but not all of them.


In summary:
Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity
Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to check security in API's 

Ans: 
4 Quick Ways to Test if Your API is Secure

    1. Parameter tampering
    2. Injection
    3. Input Fuzzing
    4. Unhandled HTTP Methods
	
1. Parameter tampering

Parameter tampering is when an attacker changes the values in an API request. This type of attack takes advantage of hidden parameters used in API requests to pass “secure” information. For example, this could be used to change the purchase price of a product by changing the value assigned to the price or cost parameter. 
To test if parameter tampering is possible, you can examine any API related elements in your site or web app through the development console in your browser. If you change the value in your console, submit it with the included change, and the application accepts it, your API is not secure. 


2. Injection

An injection attack occurs when an attacker inserts hostile input into an API. A common example is SQL injection, where SQL queries or commands are submitted, in the hope that they will be run against the backend database.

Another common example is command injection, where an attacker inserts commands into a request or input. When processed, these commands are read by the receiving system as separate from the request, and are executed as standalone commands. 

Attackers can use these attacks for many malicious purposes, including gaining access to systems through privilege escalation, rebooting devices, or deleting data.

To test if your API is vulnerable to command injection, you can try submitting a request like the following:


3. Input Fuzzing

Input fuzzing is performed by providing random information to an API through automation until an unexpected effect occurs. Often, the application will crash. Other effects might include an error message indicating that an input was partially valid. 
When performing fuzz tests, the two most common inputs to target are numbers and strings. To test number inputs, you should try submitting numbers outside the expected range, such as negative numbers, very large numbers, or decimal numbers. To test strings you can send very large strings, or strings with unexpected unicode.

Fuzzing reveals an application’s vulnerability to being remotely crashed by an attacker. It is unlikely to reveal significant weaknesses that an attacker could exploit, but is stlil useful in testing the robustness of an application



4.Unhandled HTTP Methods
To test if unsecure or unintended methods are allowed, try sending requests with known but unused and arbitrary methods. If either gets a valid response rather than an error (such as 405 or 501) you need to block those methods.

Q:Handle hidden elements ?

Ans - // Javascript executor class with executeScript method
      JavascriptExecutor j = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
      // identify element and set value
      j.executeScript ("document.getElementById('displayed-text').value='Selenium';");

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is rest assured ?
Ans - It is java lib that helps to automate the rest api's .

It can be used for writing test cases and can be integrated with maven and extent reports .Also response can be verified using this , it is compactable with diff http verbs such as put,post,delete,patch and Get.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the static imports needed for rest assured automation 
Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why static imports , why we need and what will happen agar yeh na ho to

Ans : Static import karne se (jo hum imports mein static keyword use karte hain ) , uska advantage yeh hota ki aapk kisi bhe package se koi bhe method kisi aur pacjage mein bula sakte ho without even importing the package .

simply aise kar, jaise package 1 mein 2 methods hain method1 , method2 

aap ko yeh package 2 mein bulana hai to using static in the import ypou can directly do 

method1();
methpd2();

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to get the response time from response ?
Ans 
Res.gettime();
Res.gettimeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);
Res.time();
Res.timeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Form Authentication ?

Ans :
Using Form Authentication
Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.

When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information.

Normally, the form indicates the endpoint that it'll call with its action attribute, and each input field corresponds with a form parameter sent in the request.

If the login form is simple enough and follows these rules, then we can rely on REST Assured to figure out these values for us:

given().auth()
  .form("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
  
  
Example : 
baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/api";
given()
        .auth().form("admin", "admin", new FormAuthConfig("/authentication/", "j_username", "j_password"))
.when()
        .get("/formAuth")
        .then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200);  

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to handle stale element exception ?

Ans - keeping the code which is causign stale element exception in try block and in catch block identify same element & copy same code jo issue kar 
rha tha un catch block 

see example - bmwCheckBox was causing staleekenebt exception

	
public void StaleElementHandled() throws InterruptedException {
		
		WebElement bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
		bmwCheckBox.click();
		driver.navigate().refresh();
		
		//Jo bhe statement is causing stale element out that in try block . In Catch block -followed by identifying same 
		//element once again and again keeping same line in catch block
		
		
		try {
			
		    bmwCheckBox.click();
		
		}
		
		catch(Exception e) {
			bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
			bmwCheckBox.click();
			System.out.println("Exception handled is " +  e.getMessage());
		}
	}

Q:Top down & bottom up approach 

Ans : These are different types of Integration testing

	Big bang Integration Testing - 	In big bang integration testing, testing starts only after all the modules are integrated.
    Top-down Integration Testing -	In top down integration, testing/integration starts from top modules to lower level modules.
    Bottom-up Integration Testing - In bottom up integration, testing starts from lower level modules to higher level module up in the heirarchy.
    Hybrid Integration Testing - Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom up integration testing. In this approach, the integration  starts from middle layer and testing is carried out in both the direction

Q:What is webServices 

Ans : Services available over web.All webservices are API's , howvever all API's are not webService.

Webservices uses http , api uses json/https
webservices example like rest api and soap

If API is not avialble on web/internet it is caled api else webservice 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides 
***WebServices needs internet to use the servoce however API doesnot needs internet to operate ***
Webservices uses post request , API uses any post/put/delete/get
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What is JSON ?

Ans : Understanding mein issue aye to refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfshV5n6ac
Java Script object notation - it takes the input in form of key:value pair and it starts with { or [ .{ for jsonObject and [ for jsonArray

JSON Schema : it is a schema / structural validation .Jo bhe response aa rha hai aapko , json schema is validating the expected data type and format .
jaise firstname , lastname a rha hai response mein to unki datatype string honi chaiye ---- to es case mein schema validator yhi confirm karega ki 
fields : firstname , lastname  have datatype string or not 


Steps :
1.Login to https://www.jsonschema.net/home
2.Paste your response here 
3.It will share the scheme with you 
4.Go to postman 
5.Under test tab 
6.Select tiny validator jaise aap status code ke liye karte ho 

Now paste this 



var schema = {
====== Paste ypur schema :: jo aapko yaha se mila hai  https://www.jsonschema.net/home  =============
}


var actualData = pm.response.json(); /////////////////yeh as such copy kar dena line .yeh actual response leke ayega 



pm.test('Schema is valid', function () {
    pm.expect(tv4.validate(actualData, schema)).to.be.true;
    
});

Note : In above we are validating jo hamare response mein datatype aa rhe hain har field ke against wohi aa rha hai kya nahe 
Postman mein you can validate using tiny validator (under test tab).

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.asPrettyString());
		
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Status Code is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.statusCode());
		
		System.out.println("**********Headers are :: ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.headers());
		
		Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is ItestListners ?
Ans :  ITestListener is the most adopted TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver. Providing you with an easy to implement interface through a normal Java class, where the class overrides every method declared inside the ITestListener

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Listeners in TestNG?
Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. As the name suggests Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are many types of TestNG listeners available.

AnnotationTransformer ,
IAnnotationTransformer2 ,
IConfigurable ,
IConfigurationListener ,
IExecutionListener,
IHookable ,
IInvokedMethodListener ,
IInvokedMethodListener2 ,
IMethodInterceptor ,
IReporter,
ISuiteListener,
ITestListener .

ITestListener has following methods

OnStart- OnStart method is called when any Test starts.
onTestSuccess- onTestSuccess method is called on the success of any Test.
onTestFailure- onTestFailure method is called on the failure of any Test.
onTestSkipped- onTestSkipped method is called on skipped of any Test.
onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage- method is called each time Test fails but is

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements. Similarly, one can use @FindBy with different location strategies to find web elements and perform actions on them
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can we move to element from source to desitinaion in seleniu without using action class ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?
Ans ->We have invocation count attribute in @test annotiation. We can write invocation count as 3 if we want to run it 3 times. Apart from that we can write threadpull.size if we want to run that case in multiple thread.

 @Test(invocationCount = 3)
=========================================================Added on 24 Aug =======================================================================
Q:Put vs Patch ?
Ans :The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:If you are not able to find any element then what techniques you will apply.
Ans : Might be a possibility that the element can be under some frame , so it is not foundable .To deal with , jump to that frame and work on it .Once work is done come back to original frame.

Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. 

Ans : – JSON, XML, HTML, text
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Breaking changes in API 

Ans -What Is a Breaking Change?

As the name might suggest, a breaking change to an API is any change that can break a client’s application. Usually, breaking changes involve modifying or deleting existing parts of an API.

With the latter, deletion, it’s inevitable that applications break. If a client is consuming the deleted resource, field, or structure, parts of their application will cease to function. The extent to which this really “breaks” the application can vary greatly, from having a minor cosmetic effect to making the application entirely unusable; regardless, deletion is still considered a breaking change.

Modification is less likely to break applications. Even if a client is using the resource, field, or endpoint that is modified, there’s a chance their application will continue to work as normal, depending on the implementation. For example, if a multimedia API goes from returning JPEGs to PNGs, applications that save those file types as well will most likely continue to work.

Of course, modification still carries a genuine risk of breaking client applications. Since the responsible API owner doesn’t leave these things to chance, modifications should also be treated as breaking changes.
Examples

Common examples of breaking changes include:

Best Practices for Breaking Changes
====================================
If you want to take the best possible care of your clients (and you should!), there are quite a few best practices you can adopt to avoid and mitigate breaking changes. Let’s start with how you can avoid them, since this is always preferable for developers:

    Test your code for accidental breaking changes. Breaking changes are particularly troublesome if you don’t know they’re there. Thankfully, there’s an easy solution for API owners that build against an OpenAPI specification: openapi-diff. This open-source tool compares two OpenAPI (v3) specifications and alerts you if any (obvious) breaking changes have been made.
    Future-proof your documentation. It might be cliché, but documentation really can help you avoid breaking changes — especially additive ones. For example, in the early stages of a platform, some objects may consist of just a few fields. If you know considerably more fields will be added in the future, you can instruct clients to expect this and build their applications against it.
    Carefully plan your API in advance. Once again, it might be obvious, but the importance of carefully planning your APIs cannot be understated. Even something as mundane as naming can result in breaking changes — or a persistently bad developer experience — if poorly planned.

Q:8 Where to use hashmap & where hash table?

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.
HashMap- not synchronished , HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values ,HashMap is fast. HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.
HashTables - sychronised , slow , Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value. , Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
===============================================================================
Q:What is JSON ?

Ans : Understanding mein issue aye to refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfshV5n6ac
Java Script object notation - it takes the input in form of key:value pair and it starts with { or [ .{ for jsonObject and [ for jsonArray

JSON Schema : it is a schema / structural validation .Jo bhe response aa rha hai aapko , json schema is validating the expected data type and format .
jaise firstname , lastname a rha hai response mein to unki datatype string honi chaiye ---- to es case mein schema validator yhi confirm karega ki 
fields : firstname , lastname  have datatype string or not 


Steps :
1.Login to https://www.jsonschema.net/home
2.Paste your response here 
3.It will share the scheme with you 
4.Go to postman 
5.Under test tab 
6.Select tiny validator jaise aap status code ke liye karte ho 

Now paste this 



var schema = {
====== Paste ypur schema :: jo aapko yaha se mila hai  https://www.jsonschema.net/home  =============
}


var actualData = pm.response.json(); /////////////////yeh as such copy kar dena line .yeh actual response leke ayega 



pm.test('Schema is valid', function () {
    pm.expect(tv4.validate(actualData, schema)).to.be.true;
    
});

Note : In above we are validating jo hamare response mein datatype aa rhe hain har field ke against wohi aa rha hai kya nahe 
Postman mein you can validate using tiny validator (under test tab).



===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Verify text box is highlighted or not

		signIn.click();
		
		WebElement emailTxtBox = driver.findElement(By.id("ap_email"));
		String color_Before_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;  
		jsExecutor.executeScript("arguments[0].style.background='green'", emailTxtBox);  
		
		String color_After_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		//Verfuing actually colour has changed or not 
		
		if(color_Before_Highlight.equals(color_After_Highlight)) {
			driver.quit();

Q:Q:What are the static imports needed for rest assured automation 
Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.asPrettyString());
		
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Status Code is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.statusCode());
		
		System.out.println("**********Headers are :: ***************");

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is ItestListners ?
Ans :  ITestListener is the most adopted TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver. Providing you with an easy to implement interface through a normal Java class, where the class overrides every method declared inside the ITestListener

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Listeners in TestNG?
Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. As the name suggests Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are many types of TestNG listeners available.

AnnotationTransformer ,
IAnnotationTransformer2 ,
IConfigurable ,
IConfigurationListener ,
IExecutionListener,
IHookable ,
IInvokedMethodListener ,
IInvokedMethodListener2 ,
IMethodInterceptor ,
IReporter,
ISuiteListener,
ITestListener .

ITestListener has following methods

OnStart- OnStart method is called when any Test starts.
onTestSuccess- onTestSuccess method is called on the success of any Test.
onTestFailure- onTestFailure method is called on the failure of any Test.
onTestSkipped- onTestSkipped method is called on skipped of any Test.
onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage- method is called each time Test fails but is

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What isis diff between onstart method and beforetest ?

OnStart will run at the statof the test method havign annonation as @test at the top.

Beforetest will run for he mthods having annonations @test 

Before test wil run first and then on start will run 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements. Similarly, one can use @FindBy with different location strategies to find web elements and perform actions on them
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can we move to element from source to desitinaion in seleniu without using action class ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?
Ans ->We have invocation count attribute in @test annotiation. We can write invocation count as 3 if we want to run it 3 times. Apart from that we can write threadpull.size if we want to run that case in multiple thread.

 @Test(invocationCount = 3)
=========================================================Added on 24 Aug =======================================================================
Q:Put vs Patch ?
Ans :The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:If you are not able to find any element then what techniques you will apply.
Ans : Might be a possibility that the element can be under some frame , so it is not foundable .To deal with , jump to that frame and work on it .Once work is done come back to original frame.

Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. 

Ans : – JSON, XML, HTML, text
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Breaking changes in API 

Ans -What Is a Breaking Change?

As the name might suggest, a breaking change to an API is any change that can break a client’s application. Usually, breaking changes involve modifying or deleting existing parts of an API.

With the latter, deletion, it’s inevitable that applications break. If a client is consuming the deleted resource, field, or structure, parts of their application will cease to function. The extent to which this really “breaks” the application can vary greatly, from having a minor cosmetic effect to making the application entirely unusable; regardless, deletion is still considered a breaking change.

Modification is less likely to break applications. Even if a client is using the resource, field, or endpoint that is modified, there’s a chance their application will continue to work as normal, depending on the implementation. For example, if a multimedia API goes from returning JPEGs to PNGs, applications that save those file types as well will most likely continue to work.

Of course, modification still carries a genuine risk of breaking client applications. Since the responsible API owner doesn’t leave these things to chance, modifications should also be treated as breaking changes.
Examples

Common examples of breaking changes include:

    Deleting a resource or method
    Deleting a response field
    Modifying a resource or method URI
    Modifying a field name
    Modifying required query parameters
    Modifying authorization
    Modifying rate-limiting

If you want to take the best possible care of your clients (and you should!), there are quite a few best practices you can adopt to avoid and mitigate breaking changes. Let’s start with how you can avoid them, since this is always preferable for developers:

Q:Is it mandatory to send request data in JSON format only?

Ans - No

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are Web Services?

Answer: A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet like inter-process communication on a single computer.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Messaging In Restful Web Services?

Answer: A client sends a message in the form of an HTTP Request and the server responds in the form of an HTTP Response. This technique is termed Messaging. These messages contain message data and metadata i.e. information about the message itself.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Request?
Answer: An HTTP Request has five major parts :

    Verb − Indicate HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc.
    URI − Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify the resource on the server.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Request Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Request message as key-value pairs. For example, client ( or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of the message body, cache settings, etc.
    Request Body − Message content or Resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Response?
Answer: An HTTP Response has four major parts:-

    Status/Response Code − Indicate Server status for the requested resource. For example, 404 means resource not found and 200 means response is ok.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Response Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Response message as key-value pairs. For example, content length, content type, response date, server type, etc.
    Response Body − Response message content or Resource representation.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following is the disadvantage of statelessness in RESTful web services:-

Web services need to get extra information in each request and then interpret to get the client’s state in case client interactions are to be taken care of.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Do You Mean By Idempotent Operation?
Answer: Idempotent operations mean their result will always the same no matter how many times these operations are invoked.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Idempotent?
Answer: PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Read-Only?

Answer: GET operations are read-only and are safe.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Caching?

Answer: Caching refers to storing server responses in the client itself so that a client needs not to make a server request for the same resource again and again. A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Created?
Answer: The date header provides the date and time of the resource when it was created.

Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Last Modified?
Answer: Last Modified header provides the date and time of the resource when it was last modified.


Q:Which Header Of Http Response Provides Control Over Caching?
Answer: Cache-Control is the primary header to control caching.

Q:Which Header Of Http Response Sets Expiration Date And Time Of Caching?
Answer: Expires header sets expiration date and time of caching.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Git ammend command ?

Ans : The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. 


--->git commit --amend
The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works basically the same way — first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.


 
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Clone() method ?

Ans:  The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object of a class which implements Cloneable interface. By default, it does field-by-field copy as the Object class doesn't have any idea about the members of the particular class whose objects call this method.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Differenve between beformethod and beforetest ?

Ans : 
@BeforeMethod: This will be executed before every @test annotated method.
@BeforeTest: This will be executed before the first @Test annotated method. It can be executed multiple times before the test case.

Q:Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a JVM?
Answer: JVM is Java Virtual Machine which is a run time environment for the compiled java class files.

What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

Q:Suppose there are 2 @Before and 2 @Aftr methods then how will you manage which before to run firsta nd which later on 

Ans : @Before(order=2)        -this will run first 
	@Before(order=1)			-then it will run second 
	
	@After(order=1)        -this will run first

What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Tst(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)

18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}


----Another example 

Interface 
Public  interface X
{
   public void myMethod();//abstract method 
}

Public interface Y
{
   public void myMethod();
}

Public  class JavaExample implements X, Y
{
   public void myMethod()
   {
       System.out.println("Implementing more than one interfaces");

42. What is fluent wait in selenium?
A fluent wait is a type of wait in which we can also specify polling interval(intervals after which driver will try to find the element) along with the maximum timeout value.

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Example of explicit wait 
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Syntax :
Implicit wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);	
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;	

explicit wait :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");

What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
===============================================================================

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

===============================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.


package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase1()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase1");  
 }  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase2()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase2");  
 }  
 @Test(dependsOnGroups="test")  
 public void testcase3()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase3");  
 }  
}  

===============================================================================
What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 

===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

===============================================================================
Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 

===============================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.

===============================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 

===============================================================================
Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 

===============================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Abstract methods in selenium webdriver?

Selenium WebDriver interface has many abstract methods like get(String url), quit(), close(), getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles(), getTitle() etc.

===============================================================================
Q:Difference git pull and git fetch ?

git fetch pulls latest changes done by other devs from remote reporsiroty to local repo and then you have to run merge command to merge the changes in your local

git pull -Download and merges the changes in your local.
===============================================================================
Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

===============================================================================
10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

		Thread.sleep(3000);
		
		WebElement hoverToSee = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[contains(text(),'Hover me to see')]"));
		Actions action = new Actions(driver);
	
	
		action.moveToElement(hoverToSee);
		action.clickAndHold(hoverToSee).build().perform();
		
		
		WebElement tt = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(@class,'tooltip')]"));
	String ttt = tt.getText();
	System.out.print("Text Extracted = " + ttt);
	Boolean abc = tt.isDisplayed();
	}

===============================================================================
Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

===============================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.

===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===============================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

JIT => BC ->Instructions

10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

Q:What will be the default value for reference variables ----------No Default value

Q:What is the default value for the boolean variable ----------- False 

Q:Can we declare a final global variable and use it without initializing it? -----No

Q:What are the different types of inheritance-----Single , multiple and multi-level.

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)

driver.findElement(By.id(“login”)).sendkeys(user_name);
driver.findElement(By.id(“password”)).sendkeys(password);
}


Now, go to the testng.xml file and enter the parameters there as follows:

<Suite name = “suitename”>
<test name =”testname”>
<parameter name =”user_name” value=”user1”/>
<parameter password =”password” value =”pass1”/>

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

15. In Java what is the default value of an object reference defined as an
instance variable in an Object?

Ans -Instance variables have default values. For numbers, the default value is 0, for Booleans it is false, and for object references it is null. Values can be assigned during the declaration or within the constructor.
===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

Ans -Constructor cannot be static because it cannot be call as method or variable, so no need to placing a static variable before constructor. abstract means incomplete, for complementing it we need an implementation class/interface. Constructor doesn't required to be abstract because it doesn't need to be implemented.
===============================================================================
Q:33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

This way variables cannot be called in another class .
===============================================================================
35. Why do we mark main method as static in Java?

===============================================================================
43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return
type of method in java?

Overloading is the mechanism of binding the method call with the method body dynamically based on the parameters passed to the method call. ... It is not possible to decide to execute which method based on the return type, therefore, overloading is not possible just by changing the return type of the method.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.

What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

2. How do we achieve parallel execution in TestNG?
Parallel testing or parallel execution, as the name suggests, is a process of running the test case parallelly rather than one after the other. In parallel testing, the program’s multiple parts (or modules) execute together, saving the testers a lot of time and effort. The operating system’s functionalities do this, but as a user, we need to trigger parallel execution through TestNG. As an example, you can think of having software with two different versions and running them in parallel with the help of TestNG. Parallel execution would give us the correct idea of the stability and performance of the software much faster than running serially.

Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);

1. What's the fastest locator in Selenium?

Id is fastest and then comes name
===============================================================================
2. What does ::(double colon) in sibling xpaths represent?
A double colon :: is used to separate the axis specifier from the node test.
===============================================================================
4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
Q: WHat is thread in testNG.XML file in case of parallel testing ?

Threads in parallel testing refer to different parts in which the test execution will be divided and run parallelly

So if there are two threads and two methods, they will take one method each and run them parallelly (if we are running the methods parallelly). But if there are three methods and two threads, one will have to wait until one thread is free and takes up that method for execution. Therefore, we need to specify the number of threads we want to run while performing parallel testing in TestNG.


<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name = "Parallel Testing Suite">
   <test name = "Parallel Tests" parallel = "methods" thread-count = "2">--------------------------------Es ki baat ho rhi hai 
      <classes>
         <class name = "ParallelTest" />
      </classes>
   </test>
</suite>


Note - example let us suppose there are 3 methods and you defined thread as 2 .then 2 parallel chalenge , aur jab ek thread free hogi tab woh 3rd method ke liye chalega .In this case 2 methods ka same thread id hoga aur 3rd ka alag ...
===============================================================================
As I mentioned, if we run the test methods directly through the test case file (Run As -> TestNG Test) rather than the XML file, they will run serially. Run the file in the same way (serially) and notice the time taken for overall execution.
===============================================================================
17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.

Drop the pen from some height (Table height) in the upside-down position. Verify if you are able to write with this pen. By mistake, the pen can any time fall on the ground. So testing this possibility to know its impact, will help us in knowing the quality of the pen
===============================================================================
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

8) If try With Multiple catch Block Present, Is Order of catch Blocks Important in 
Which Order We Have To Take?

Yes , jaise aapke codd mein pehle arthmetic error aani hai to pehle uske respective catch block hona chaiye ..
agli exception say IO error h , then uske respective block hona chaiye 
===============================================================================
10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--
===============================================================================
11)Is it Possible To Take try, catch Inside try Block?
No , In Java, we can use a try block within a try block. Each time a try statement is entered, the context of that exception is pushed on to a stack

===============================================================================
16)In Which Situation Finally Block Will Not Executed?
Ans - if try block will have a statement System.exit();
===============================================================================
17)If Return Statement Present Inside try, is Finally Block Will Be Executed?
Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed.
===============================================================================
19)Is it Possible To Write Any Statement Between try-catch And finally?
No, we cannot write any statements in between try, catch and finally blocks and these blocks form one unit
===============================================================================
20)Is it Possible To Take 2 finally Blocks For The Same try?
You can only have one finally clause per try/catch/finally statement
===============================================================================
29)Is it Possible To Use throws Keyword For Any Java Class?
No ,It is used in method definition, to declare that a risky method is being called.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory.

1.Install the Auto it in your machine 
2.After installation it will go to c:/program(x86)/autoit
3.There is a file - Au3Info_x64 - which is basically a finder 
4.Scite is a file which is a editior 

--Commands : controlfocus , controlsetTest,ControlClick(These two be used in AutoIt)

Note : InetGet is used in Auto it to Downloads a file from the internet using the HTTP, HTTPS or FTP protocol.

Run auto it script in selenium
Runtime.getRuntime().exe

Q: What are Broken Links?
Broken links are links or URLs that are not reachable. They may be down or not functioning due to some server error

An URL will always have a status with 2xx which is valid. There are different HTTP status codes which are having different purposes. For an invalid request, HTTP status is 4xx and 5xx.

Why should you check Broken links?
You should always make sure that there are no broken links on the site because the user should not land into an error page.

The error happens if the rules are not updated correctly, or the requested resources are not existing at the server.

Manual checking of links is a tedious task, because each webpage may have a large number of links & manual process has to be repeated for all pages.

===============================================================================
Q: what is the tag present for links and images in DOM 

Links ---a--- it will have property href
Images ----img--it will have property href

Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

Collections: HashMap-----key and value. If we have states and cities, which will be the key ?
HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.

17. Automation is running fine kn chrome but failing on IE . What could be the reason.
During cross browser testing, it is sometimes found that one test script fails in one browser, where it passes in a different browser. What is the reason behind this? Is there any specific reason why this happens, for java- selenium web driver, test scripts?


Ans - It happens due to  element locators postions changes from one web page to other webpage
The crazy thing about Chrome, Firefox and IE is that all three run at different speeds. I've found Chrome to be the fastest, Firefox to be the middle ground and IE to be the slowest. That means I typically have to build in enough explicit waits so they pass for Chrome's speed (otherwise I get elements aren't clickable) but make sure my timeouts are high enough so that my IE test runs don't timeout.

53. Is it possible to achieve Runtime Polymorphism by data members in
Java?
Ans-A method is overridden, not the data members, so runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
===============================================================================
59. Is it allowed to mark a method abstract as well as final?
Ans - No , doing so i am getting the mentioned error 
The abstract method testing in type AbstarctClassExample can only set a visibility modifier, one of public or protected
===============================================================================
62. Is it allowed to mark an method in interface as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.
==============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses

10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--

===============================================================================
Can we overload and override constructor

What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.

===============================================================================
Q:What is unreachable catch block error?

A block of statements to which the control can never reach under any case can be called as unreachable blocks. Unreachable blocks are not supported by Java. The catch block mentioned with the reference of Exception class should and must be always last catch block because Exception is the superclass of all exceptions. When we are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones.

When you are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones. i.e sub classes of Exception must come first and super classes later. If you keep super classes first and sub classes later, compiler will show unreachable catch block err

No, you cannot.

No. If a super class method is throwing an unchecked exception, then it can be overridden in the sub class with same exception or any other unchecked exceptions but can not be overridden with checked exceptions
===============================================================================
Q:What are chained exceptions in java

Chained Exception helps to identify a situation in which one exception causes another Exception in an application. For instance, consider a method which throws an ArithmeticException because of an attempt to divide by zero but the actual cause of exception was an I/O error which caused the divisor to be zero

Q: Example of method overriding in selenium framework ?

Examples of Method Overriding
In the WebDriver interface, we use two different methods for navigating or accessing any website i.e. driver.get() and driver.navigate().to().

These two methods are examples of Method Overriding.

Enlisted below is the basic difference between the navigate() and get() method and this is frequently asked in Selenium Interviews.

The get() method does not load the web page completely if you are going to do some other operation after loading a page. This is the reason for which get() is faster than navigate().
Using get() method, you can not traverse back and forward whereas Navigate() supports back and forth traversal of a web page using navigate().forward() and navigate().back().

Ans - Yes 
===============================================================================================================================================
****Q:What Will Happen If We Do Not Override All the Abstract Methods in Sub-class
Ans- If you wan't to override only one of these methods in your subclass, the subclass will have to be declared as abstract as well.
===============================================================================
Q:Can abstract class be final in Java?
Ans-No
===============================================================================
Q:Can abstract class contains main method in Java?
Ans-Yes, you can use the main() method in abstract class. The main() method is a static method so it is associated with Class, not with object or instance. The abstract is applicable to the object so there is no problem if it contains the main method.

}

@Test(groups="smoke")
public void M2(){
system.out.printLn("M2");
}


@Test(groups="smoke" , "regression")
public void M3(){
system.out.printLn("M3");
}

Now you want to run particular group test cases

Q: What is grouping in testNG ?

Ans : TestNG Groups allow you to perform groupings of different test methods. Grouping of test methods is required when you want to access the test methods of different classes.

Jaise 3 classes hain all wants to run method for a group say smoke which we created in testNG.xml file , in that case aap 3 classes mein un un methods ke upar groups mention kar do jaha aap chahato ho woh es group ke liye chale .Kyn ki saari classes ki testNG.xml same he hogi 

example 

package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Personal_loan  
{  
 @Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
 public void WebLoginPersonalLoan()  
 {  
     System.out.println("Web Login Personal Loan");  
 }  
 }
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Home_loan   
{  
@Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
public void MobileLoginHomeLoan()  
{  
  System.out.println("Mobile Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test  
public void APILoginHomeLoan()  
{  
  System.out.println("API Login Home Loan");  
}  
}  




package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Car_loan   
{  
@Test  
public void WebLoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("Web Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test  
public void MobileLoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("Mobile Login Home Loan");  
}  
@Test(groups= {"SmokeTest"})  
public void APILoginCarLoan()  
{  
System.out.println("API Login Home Loan");  
}  
}  



Now, we create a testng.xml file where we configure the classes that we have created and add new tag <groups>. We want to execute those test cases which have a group "SmokeTest".

?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">  
<suite name="test_suite">

Q:Real example of Abstrction in sleenoum framework ?
Ans :
These concepts are commonly used in framework development. Abstract class is used in defining a common super class while writing Page Object Model layer of the framework. We usually create an abstract class named BasePage to have all common members for every page written in this class e.g getPageTitle().

Then each Page class (HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage etc.) inherit from BasePage. Sometimes one may need to change the behavior of methods implemented in superclass. So subclass has freedom to override that method where we use polymorphism. This is how we use Abstract class in real projects.

Q:17.What is the difference between vector list and arraylist

Vector is synchronized.
Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if the total number of elements exceeds than its capacity.
Vector is slow because it is synchronized


ArrayList is not synchronized.
ArrayList increments 50% of current array size if the number of elements exceeds from its capacity.
ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.

Q:Which is the package which is to be imported while working with WebDriver ?

Ans- org.openqa.selenium
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Use of constructor in selenium?
Ans: Constructor is special method which name is same as class name and it mainly used for initialisation purpose.

Whenerever we create an object of a class constructor gets called and we can initialise objects.

As a part of selenium , we need to syncronize object of WebDriver .ex. - driver

We can have multiple classes for different features but driver should be one and sync with all.

So it is preferable that we should sync driver whenever class getting called.


Also , 
Constructor is one of the approaches how you can initialize elements associated with your page. Here you just use the classic way to initialize everything when you object is being instantiated.

For example: below is the LoginPage’s parameterized constructor which will instantiate webDriver for you with the Object creation of this page itself.

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {            
             this.driver = driver;  
             PageFactory.initElements(driver, this); 
    } 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is API ?
Ans : API-Application Programming Interface 
it acts between UI and DB layer and is present in Business layer 

API can work between two  different technologies 
API can work between two  different Platform (Mobile and Web)-Example mobile mein whatspp par aap location share karte ho , us vase mein whatsapp is using goole API
API can work between frontend and Backend (DB)
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the most used template for API documentation?
Here, are the various documentation template that make the whole process simple and easy. They are:

Swagger
Miredot
Slate
FlatDoc
API blueprint
RestDoc
Web service API specification
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the way to represent the resource in REST?
REST uses different representation to define the resources like text, JSON and XML. The most popular representation of resources is JSON and XML.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the characteristics of REST?
Here, are the two characteristics of REST.

REST is stateless. With the use of the REST API the server has no status, we can restart the server between two calls, inspite of all the data is transferred to the server.
Web Services uses POST method to perform operations, while REST uses GET method to access the resources.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is messaging in RESTFUL Web Services?
RESTFUL Web Services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server. This is the technique when the client sends a message in the form of HTTP request the server send back the HTTP reply which is called Messaging.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Diff in C++ and Java ?
Ans : Java - Platform independent , multiple inheritance is not possble , Java doesn't support operator overloading.Java supports call by value only.


C++-Platform dependent , multiple inheritance is possible , C++ supports both call by value and call by reference. , supports operator overloading
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are some of the architectural styles for creating a Web API?
Some of the architectural styles for creating web api are as follows.

Simple URI as the address for the services
Stateless communication
HTTP for client-server communication
XML/JSON as formatting language
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the types of bugs we face when performing API testing?
Ans : Stress, performance, and security issues
Duplicate or missing functionality
Reliability issues

Ans : 1.Using extends keyword 
2.Using by creating object of parent and the using it 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How compiler will come to know what type of exception progm is going to thrwo?
Ans : 
Thus, the signature tells the compiler that it could throw this type of exception . The way catch blocks work, if an exception is thrown in a try block, execution goes through each cacth block and looks to see if the type of exception in the catch block is a polymorphic match for the thrown exception
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is use of intern() method ?
Ans : The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap memory and stores it in the String constant pool. Note that, if another String with the same contents exists in the String constant pool, then a new object won't be created and the new reference will point to the other String.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why we cannot crate an object of abstract and interface ?
Ans : No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class because it does not have a complete implementation. 
The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses. It acts like a template, or an empty or partially empty structure, you should extend it and build on it before you can use it.

Q:Who writes the feature file -----------QA / Dev / BA 
Q:Advantages of cucumber ----It has feature file which uses english like language and anyone read this w/o having any code knowledge
Q:Can we put implicit and explicit all together in same script ------------ 
Ans : Not a good practice , script slow hp jaeygi 

Setting Explicit Wait is important in cases where there are certain elements that naturally take more time to load. If one sets an implicit wait command, then the browser will wait for the same time frame before loading every web element. This causes an unnecessary delay in executing the test script.

Explicit wait is more intelligent, but can only be applied for specified elements. However, it is an improvement on implicit wait since it allows the program to pause for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

Q:Class C extends class B , class B extends A .Now can we call the method of A into Class C using super.super.methodofA?????---------------No

Ans :
// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Parent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Child extends Parent {
    public void Print()
    {
        // Trying to access Grandparent's Print()
        super.super.Print();
        System.out.println("Child's Print()");
    }
}
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Child c = new Child();
        c.Print();
    }
}
Output:

prog.java:20: error: <identifier> expected
        super.super.Print();
              ^
prog.java:20: error: not a statement
        super.super.Print(); 
There is an error at the line “super.super.print();”. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members. It is allowed in C++ though.




It can be done as 

// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        super.Print();
        System.out.println("Parent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Child extends Parent {
    public void Print()
    {
        super.Print();
        System.out.println("Child's Print()");
    }
}
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Child c = new Child();
        c.Print();

}
Output
Grandparent's Print()

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is collision in Hashmap ?
Ans : Collisions in the HashMap
A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.


collision resolution techniques comes into play only when multiple keys end up with the same hashcode (i.e., they fall in the same bucket location) where an entry is already stored. HashMap handles the collision resolution by using the concept of chaining i.e., it stores the values in a linked list 

chaining, i.e. they use linked list to store map entries which ended in the same bucket due to a collision. If a key end up in the same bucket location where entry is already stored then this entry is just added at the head of the linked list there.

Q:Name some CI/CD tools .
Ans : Jenkins , Bamboo , Apache 
===============================================================================================================================================
DevOps --> It is formed with the combination of developer + operations(Jo code deploy karega) .They work together and deliver the deliverables more fastly , accurately and 
in less time 

The moment code is developed - it is pushed to repository using version control tool say git ----> further pushed to CI/CD tool say jenkins .Jenkins 
will test the functionality as soon as the new code is pushed .This complete cycle is CI .
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Advantages of agile ?
Ans :
1.Requirements are more understandable as you gets continuos feedback from client 
2.Delievry are done at quite faster rate - deliverying the deliverables in every sprint whihc happens every week or biweekenly 
===============================================================================================================================================
*********Q:Phases of DevOps ?
Ans : Devops has 8 phases ::

Plan ---  code 


1.Plan - We sit with business team to understand the requirements / understand the goals
2.Code - where you start doing coding , devs use git / git hub to push their code 
3.Build - build the code using tools like gradle , maven 
4.Integrate - integrate together the different all stages using tool like jenkins 
5.Test - test the application using tools like selenium 
6.Deploy - Tools used to deploy the code to prod servers 
7.Operate - Jab coe deploy ho gya prod servers mein then checking it whether it is working as expected or not .Tools like puppet/Dockers are used for it 
8.Monitor  - Monitoring the complete environment , kuch issues / bug aaye to dekhna 

===============================================================================================================================================
Devops bascially integrate the development with operations 
Dvelopment includes - Plan , code , build , test 

-------Intergrate using jenkins / Bamboo with below phases ---------
Deploy , operate , monitor  


This helps o make speedy and more perfectly and early feedaback can be expected using devops in agile .

If code fails after test (stage 4 ) then code is resent bak to dev , else ushe hum deploy kar dete hain (step 6).

Q:Properties of hashmap 
Lets say there is a hashmap , for which jis key ki hum value nikal rhe hain .Woh key exists he nahe karti to value kya hogi 

Ans :
1.Doesnot maintain insertion order 
2.Stores value in key-value pair 
3.Cannot have duplicate key
4.Agar jaise kisi ne multiple null values di hai aur woh at the time of extraction of value woh null key ko bulata hai 
say like 
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD");
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD11");

In the result --- tumhe error nahe milega but when you will do Hashmap.get(null)-- it will return value ABCD1



HashMap<String , String> capticalMap = new HashMap<String , String>();

capticalMap.put("India","New Delhi");
capticalMap.put("USA","Washington DC");
capticalMap.put("UK","London");


//Extracting value from map 

System.out.println(capticalMap.get("India"));

Q:Explain public static void main(String args[])
Public - access specifier 
static - keyword
void - return type 
main - method name 
String args[] - arguments we are passing 
Q:Name all access specifier 
Q:Why argument in public static void main(String args[]) is string not other type 

Ans :because string can be converted to any datatype and in addtion if we pass null argument when using string then also it will not create any issue 

Q:


===============================================================================================================================================
*******Q:Explain the statements and also tell what is the differnce between both 

double a = 100 ;
double a = (double) 100;

Ans :: In first case , we are assigning value to variable a as 100 and data type of a is double .So the value will be like 100.00 and size will be of 8 byte 

In second case , we are type casting the value .Basically 100 jo hai woh int value hai usko double mein convert karne ke liye we re doing this .Int ka size 4 byte hota hai after casting it to double it will be chnage to 8 byte 

*****Implicit and explicit / up & downcasting  yaha woh use ho rha hai .
Int -----> double (Up casting)

Q:Q:If in case agar aapko yeh nahe pta kitne argument spass karne hai kisi method mein , lets say aaj ek method hai say 
public void m1(String SS ) ----kal yeh method ko aap reuse karna chaho aur aap es mein 2 string ya 2 int aur pass karna chaho to
aur you want to use concept of reuse how can be done 

Ans - 1.Method Overloading jaise 
public void m1(String SS ) 
public void m2(String SS , Int a ) 


2nd Way ::
always declare argument like 

public void m1(Object.. Obj)=======>>==============>>

ab kya hai na Object.. declare karne se aap kitne bhe variables declare kar sakte ho , aur woh method ko kitni marji baar bula sakte ho  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

*********Q:Why would it be more secure to store sensitive data (such as a password, social security number, etc.) in a character array rather than in a String?

Ans - In Java, Strings are immutable and are stored in the String pool. What this means is that, once a String is created, it stays in the pool in memory until being garbage collected. Therefore, even after you’re done processing the string value (e.g., the password), it remains available in memory for an indeterminate period of time thereafter (again, until being garbage collected) which you have no real control over. Therefore, anyone having access to a memory dump can potentially extract the sensitive data and exploit it.

In contrast, if you use a mutable object like a character array, for example, to store the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it with confidence that it will no longer be retained in memory.

Q:1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.

The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.

A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.

Q:Q:Difference between cross join and inner join ?
Ans :
CROSS JOIN:
-------------------

SELECT 
    Movies.CustomerID, Movies.Movie, Customers.Age, 
    Customers.Gender, Customers.[Education Level], 
    Customers.[Internet Connection], Customers.[Marital Status], 
FROM   
    Customers 
CROSS JOIN 
    Movies
	

INNER JOIN:
---------------------
SELECT 
    Movies.CustomerID, Movies.Movie, Customers.Age, 
    Customers.Gender, Customers.[Education Level], 
    Customers.[Internet Connection], Customers.[Marital Status]
FROM   
    Customers 
INNER JOIN 
    Movies ON Customers.CustomerID = Movies.CustomerID

***Cross join does not combine the rows, if you have 100 rows in each table with 1 to 1 match, you get 10.000 results, Innerjoin will only return 100 rows in the same situation.

Q:Q:Advantages of using rest assured 

Ans : It removes the need for writing a lot of boilerplate code required to set up an HTTP connection, send a request and receive and parse a response

It supports a Given/When/Then test notation, which instantly makes your tests human readable

Since REST Assured is a Java library, integrating it into a continuous integration / continuous delivery setup is a breeze, especially when combined with a Java testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q:Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?

Ans :The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:can we override a static method or main method?
Ans : No , Static ka right apni class mein he hoga
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:what is Dictionary in java?
Ans : 
A java dictionary is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key, its corresponding value can be stored and retrieved as needed; thus, a dictionary is a list of key-value pairs.

The first step to creating a dictionary in Java is to choose a class that implements a “key-value pair” interface; a few examples include HashTables, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Example : 

/ creating a My HashTable Dictionary
		Hashtable<String, String> my_dict = new Hashtable<String, String>();

    // Using a few dictionary Class methods
		// using put method
		my_dict.put("01", "Apple");
		my_dict.put("10", "Banana");
		
		// using get() method
    System.out.println("\nValue at key = 10 : " + my_dict.get("10")); 
    System.out.println("Value at key = 11 : " + my_dict.get("11"));
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:How to declare constant variables 

Ans: To turn an ordinary variable into a constant, you have to use the keyword "final."
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class --- Yes 

Q:Is abstract class 100% abstract? Explain ---- No, gar interface hota to 100% hoti

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is auto Widening and Explicit Narrowing?
Ans: The data is implicitly casted from small sized primitive type to big sized primitive type. This is called auto-widening. i.e The data is automatically casted from byte to short, short to int, int to long, long to float and float to double..
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which is the uppermost class for all the classes in java

Ans - Object
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain “toString()” of Object class

Ans: Output ko string mein convert karta hai 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain hashcode method in object ?

Ans : returns the hashcode number for this object.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Git ammend command ?

Ans : The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. 


--->git commit --amend
The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works basically the same way — first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Clone() method ?

Ans:  The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object of a class which implements Cloneable interface. By default, it does field-by-field copy as the Object class doesn't have any idea about the members of the particular class whose objects call this method.

Q:Q:Agile requirements 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM_m6EzMg3k


Ans : EPIC ------->Feature -------> User Story -------> Task

Scrum Roles -------> Product owner  -------> Scrum master -------> Scurm Team 


1.Product Owner -  Understanding req of customer , he notes what customer wants & he understand what is the req . Documents what customer wants in form of epic , maintains product backlog ( tracks what status the software is ) , team members will pick itmes from product backlog , Product owner also manabegs the release 

Product Backlog - In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.


2.Scrum master - He is intermediater between product owner and team , He checks if the scrum is correctly forllowed , he also makes sure team breaks down feature into story , he manages the things between  team , helps to resolve the roadblock if any .


3.Scrum Team - works on delivery , ike dev team , QA team . if they have any issue they can contact scrum owner 




Sprint Activities ::
--------------------------
Userstories broken into small stories and stroies to be delivered into small time .This is called Sprint .

Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done

Explanation 
1.Story - jo kaam aaya hai jaise add payment method as payonline / add some button on UI / ya kuch bhe 
2.To Do - Jo kaam shuru karna hai say you picked user story - Add button to UI 
3.In progress - Yaha woh kaam ayega aap kar rhe ho presently 
4.Testing - Jis feature ki teating kar rhe ho
5.Done - Jo develop aur test donno ho chuke hain

Q:Q:What is difference between sel 3 &4

Ans : The architecture for Selenium 3 includes the JSON Wire Protocol. However, Selenium 4 does not include the JSON Wire Protocol, and that’s the contrast between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON Protocol is used to transfer information between Selenium client (webDriver) and Browser driver 


Sekenium 4 ::
Selenium 4 has direct communication between the client and server. The client still has 2 parts (Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings) while Browser Drivers are the server.

Selenium Client sends out a request to perform a command.
The WebDriver Language Bindings is a code library designed to drive actions.
Browser Drivers receive the request and then return a response after an automation Test Script executes on the Web Browser:


Selenium4 is more stable then selenium 3.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What is agile and ohase in agile 

Ans : Agile is a iterative approach in which the deliverables are deilievred in small span of time.

Phases ::

Plan 
Implement 
Test 
Review - if review at the end is satisfactory then we add it to build , else we need to come back to upar wale phases for further improvements

Hasnext - will return boolean , either true or false 
next - it will give next value 
Q:*********what is Iterator in java?

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Make a collection
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");

    // Get the iterator
    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();

Q:Difference between where and having and use of it?

Ans -The WHERE clause in MySQL is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries to filter data from the table or relation. The WHERE clause in MySQL can also implement the logical connectives AND, OR, and NOT

    SELECT column_lists,     
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists;  
	
	

Having -
HAVING clause in MySQL used in conjunction with GROUP BY clause enables us to specify conditions that filter which group results appear in the result. 

    SELECT column_lists,     
    aggregate_function (expression)    
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Ans :
// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {

    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Parent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Child extends Parent {
    public void Print()
    {
        // Trying to access Grandparent's Print()
        super.super.Print();
        System.out.println("Child's Print()");
    }
}
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Child c = new Child();
        c.Print();
    }
}
Output:

prog.java:20: error: <identifier> expected
        super.super.Print();
              ^
prog.java:20: error: not a statement
        super.super.Print(); 
There is an error at the line “super.super.print();”. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members. It is allowed in C++ though.




It can be done as 

// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        super.Print();
        System.out.println("Parent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Child extends Parent {
    public void Print()
    {
        super.Print();
        System.out.println("Child's Print()");

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is collision in Hashmap ?
Ans : Collisions in the HashMap
A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.


collision resolution techniques comes into play only when multiple keys end up with the same hashcode (i.e., they fall in the same bucket location) where an entry is already stored. HashMap handles the collision resolution by using the concept of chaining i.e., it stores the values in a linked list 

chaining, i.e. they use linked list to store map entries which ended in the same bucket due to a collision. If a key end up in the same bucket location where entry is already stored then this entry is just added at the head of the linked list there.

Q:Name some CI/CD tools .
Ans : Jenkins , Bamboo , Apache 
===============================================================================================================================================
DevOps --> It is formed with the combination of developer + operations(Jo code deploy karega) .They work together and deliver the deliverables more fastly , accurately and 
in less time 

The moment code is developed - it is pushed to repository using version control tool say git ----> further pushed to CI/CD tool say jenkins .Jenkins 
will test the functionality as soon as the new code is pushed .This complete cycle is CI .
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Advantages of agile ?
Ans :
1.Requirements are more understandable as you gets continuos feedback from client 
2.Delievry are done at quite faster rate - deliverying the deliverables in every sprint whihc happens every week or biweekenly 
===============================================================================================================================================
*********Q:Phases of DevOps ?
Ans : Devops has 8 phases ::

Plan ---  code 


1.Plan - We sit with business team to understand the requirements / understand the goals
2.Code - where you start doing coding , devs use git / git hub to push their code 
3.Build - build the code using tools like gradle , maven 
4.Integrate - integrate together the different all stages using tool like jenkins 
5.Test - test the application using tools like selenium 
6.Deploy - Tools used to deploy the code to prod servers 
7.Operate - Jab coe deploy ho gya prod servers mein then checking it whether it is working as expected or not .Tools like puppet/Dockers are used for it 
8.Monitor  - Monitoring the complete environment , kuch issues / bug aaye to dekhna 

===============================================================================================================================================
Devops bascially integrate the development with operations 
Dvelopment includes - Plan , code , build , test 

-------Intergrate using jenkins / Bamboo with below phases ---------
Deploy , operate , monitor  


This helps o make speedy and more perfectly and early feedaback can be expected using devops in agile .

If code fails after test (stage 4 ) then code is resent bak to dev , else ushe hum deploy kar dete hain (step 6).

Q:Properties of hashmap 
Lets say there is a hashmap , for which jis key ki hum value nikal rhe hain .Woh key exists he nahe karti to value kya hogi 

Ans :
1.Doesnot maintain insertion order 
2.Stores value in key-value pair 
3.Cannot have duplicate key
4.Agar jaise kisi ne multiple null values di hai aur woh at the time of extraction of value woh null key ko bulata hai 
say like 
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD");
HashMap.put(null,"ABCD11");

In the result --- tumhe error nahe milega but when you will do Hashmap.get(null)-- it will return value ABCD1



HashMap<String , String> capticalMap = new HashMap<String , String>();

capticalMap.put("India","New Delhi");
capticalMap.put("USA","Washington DC");
capticalMap.put("UK","London");


//Extracting value from map 

System.out.println(capticalMap.get("India"));

Q:Explain public static void main(String args[])
Public - access specifier 
static - keyword
void - return type 
main - method name 
String args[] - arguments we are passing 
Q:Name all access specifier 
Q:Why argument in public static void main(String args[]) is string not other type 

Ans :because string can be converted to any datatype and in addtion if we pass null argument when using string then also it will not create any issue 

Q:


===============================================================================================================================================
*******Q:Explain the statements and also tell what is the differnce between both 

double a = 100 ;
double a = (double) 100;

Ans :: In first case , we are assigning value to variable a as 100 and data type of a is double .So the value will be like 100.00 and size will be of 8 byte 

In second case , we are type casting the value .Basically 100 jo hai woh int value hai usko double mein convert karne ke liye we re doing this .Int ka size 4 byte hota hai after casting it to double it will be chnage to 8 byte 

*****Implicit and explicit / up & downcasting  yaha woh use ho rha hai .
Int -----> double (Up casting)

Q:Q:If in case agar aapko yeh nahe pta kitne argument spass karne hai kisi method mein , lets say aaj ek method hai say 
public void m1(String SS ) ----kal yeh method ko aap reuse karna chaho aur aap es mein 2 string ya 2 int aur pass karna chaho to
aur you want to use concept of reuse how can be done 

Ans - 1.Method Overloading jaise 
public void m1(String SS ) 
public void m2(String SS , Int a ) 


2nd Way ::
always declare argument like 

public void m1(Object.. Obj)=======>>==============>>

ab kya hai na Object.. declare karne se aap kitne bhe variables declare kar sakte ho , aur woh method ko kitni marji baar bula sakte ho  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance.

Q:What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? 
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.

Q:Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Q:Q:Difference between cross join and inner join ?
Ans :
CROSS JOIN:
-------------------

SELECT 
    Movies.CustomerID, Movies.Movie, Customers.Age, 
    Customers.Gender, Customers.[Education Level], 
    Customers.[Internet Connection], Customers.[Marital Status], 
FROM   
    Customers 
CROSS JOIN 
    Movies
	

INNER JOIN:
---------------------
SELECT 
    Movies.CustomerID, Movies.Movie, Customers.Age, 
    Customers.Gender, Customers.[Education Level], 
    Customers.[Internet Connection], Customers.[Marital Status]
FROM   
    Customers 
INNER JOIN 
    Movies ON Customers.CustomerID = Movies.CustomerID

***Cross join does not combine the rows, if you have 100 rows in each table with 1 to 1 match, you get 10.000 results, Innerjoin will only return 100 rows in the same situation.

Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q:Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?

Ans :The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:can we override a static method or main method?
Ans : No , Static ka right apni class mein he hoga
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:what is Dictionary in java?
Ans : 
A java dictionary is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key, its corresponding value can be stored and retrieved as needed; thus, a dictionary is a list of key-value pairs.

The first step to creating a dictionary in Java is to choose a class that implements a “key-value pair” interface; a few examples include HashTables, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Example : 

/ creating a My HashTable Dictionary
		Hashtable<String, String> my_dict = new Hashtable<String, String>();

    // Using a few dictionary Class methods
		// using put method
		my_dict.put("01", "Apple");
		my_dict.put("10", "Banana");
		
		// using get() method
    System.out.println("\nValue at key = 10 : " + my_dict.get("10")); 
    System.out.println("Value at key = 11 : " + my_dict.get("11"));
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:How to declare constant variables 

Ans: To turn an ordinary variable into a constant, you have to use the keyword "final."
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class --- Yes 

Q:Is abstract class 100% abstract? Explain ---- No, gar interface hota to 100% hoti

Q:What is auto Widening and Explicit Narrowing?
Ans: The data is implicitly casted from small sized primitive type to big sized primitive type. This is called auto-widening. i.e The data is automatically casted from byte to short, short to int, int to long, long to float and float to double..
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which is the uppermost class for all the classes in java

Ans - Object
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain “toString()” of Object class

Ans: Output ko string mein convert karta hai 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain hashcode method in object ?

Ans : returns the hashcode number for this object.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Git ammend command ?

Ans : The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. 


--->git commit --amend
The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last commit.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works basically the same way — first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Clone() method ?

Ans:  The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object of a class which implements Cloneable interface. By default, it does field-by-field copy as the Object class doesn't have any idea about the members of the particular class whose objects call this method.

Q:Q:Agile requirements 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM_m6EzMg3k


Ans : EPIC ------->Feature -------> User Story -------> Task

Scrum Roles -------> Product owner  -------> Scrum master -------> Scurm Team 


1.Product Owner -  Understanding req of customer , he notes what customer wants & he understand what is the req . Documents what customer wants in form of epic , maintains product backlog ( tracks what status the software is ) , team members will pick itmes from product backlog , Product owner also manabegs the release 

Product Backlog - In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.


2.Scrum master - He is intermediater between product owner and team , He checks if the scrum is correctly forllowed , he also makes sure team breaks down feature into story , he manages the things between  team , helps to resolve the roadblock if any .


3.Scrum Team - works on delivery , ike dev team , QA team . if they have any issue they can contact scrum owner 




Sprint Activities ::
--------------------------
Userstories broken into small stories and stroies to be delivered into small time .This is called Sprint .

Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done

Explanation 
1.Story - jo kaam aaya hai jaise add payment method as payonline / add some button on UI / ya kuch bhe 
2.To Do - Jo kaam shuru karna hai say you picked user story - Add button to UI 
3.In progress - Yaha woh kaam ayega aap kar rhe ho presently 
4.Testing - Jis feature ki teating kar rhe ho
5.Done - Jo develop aur test donno ho chuke hain

Q:Q:What is difference between sel 3 &4

Ans : The architecture for Selenium 3 includes the JSON Wire Protocol. However, Selenium 4 does not include the JSON Wire Protocol, and that’s the contrast between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON Protocol is used to transfer information between Selenium client (webDriver) and Browser driver 


Sekenium 4 ::
Selenium 4 has direct communication between the client and server. The client still has 2 parts (Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings) while Browser Drivers are the server.

Selenium Client sends out a request to perform a command.
The WebDriver Language Bindings is a code library designed to drive actions.
Browser Drivers receive the request and then return a response after an automation Test Script executes on the Web Browser:


Selenium4 is more stable then selenium 3.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:What is agile and ohase in agile 

Ans : Agile is a iterative approach in which the deliverables are deilievred in small span of time.

Phases ::

Plan 
Implement 
Test 
Review - if review at the end is satisfactory then we add it to build , else we need to come back to upar wale phases for further improvements

HashSet stores only objects no such key value pairs maintained.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Where do you use a hashmap?
Ans: Maps are used for when you want to associate a key with a value and Lists are an ordered collection. Map is an interface in the Java Collection Framework and a HashMap is one implementation of the Map interface. HashMap are efficient for locating a value based on a key and inserting and deleting values based on a key. HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

// Add elements to the map
map.put(“vishal”, 10);
map.put(“sachin”, 30);
map.put(“vaibhav”, 20);

// Print size and content
System.out.println(“Size of map is:- ”
+ map.size());
System.out.println(map);

// Check if a key is present and if
// present, print value
if (map.containsKey(“vishal”)) {
Integer a = map.get(“vishal”);

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

Q:How do you manage to re-run only failed test cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Data Binding in Java ?
Ans :Data Binding
If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

public class GFG {
    
  //static instance of class globally accessible
  public static GFG instance = new GFG();
  private GFG() {
    // private constructor so that class
    //cannot be instantiated from outside

Q:
Q:Difference between where and having and use of it?

Ans -The WHERE clause in MySQL is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries to filter data from the table or relation. The WHERE clause in MySQL can also implement the logical connectives AND, OR, and NOT

    SELECT column_lists,     
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists;  
	
	

Having -
HAVING clause in MySQL used in conjunction with GROUP BY clause enables us to specify conditions that filter which group results appear in the result. 

    SELECT column_lists,     
    aggregate_function (expression)    
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE conditions  
    GROUP BY column_lists

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Ans: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework
Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.

And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Examples:
|filename|
|file1|
|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
#18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Below is the syntax of Cucumber Options tag:

@CucumberOptions(features="Features",glue={"StepDefinition"})

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #24) What is the name of the plugin that is used to integrate Eclipse with Cucumber?

=======================================================================
5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?

name[1] = “book”
------->>>>
however we can directly put objectnin arraylist
No index required.

name.add(“book”)
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes
double and float variables  -8byte/4byte and precision (2 decimal and single decimal)

Final Keyword   -class/vari/method
==========================================================================================================================================================
base class in Java -Java.lang.object
==========================================================================================================================================================
Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

================================================
Multiple Window in Selenium ::
getWindowHandle() method return a string value and it returns the Window handle of current focused browser window. 

getWindowHandles() method returns a set of all Window handles of all the browsers that were opened in the session.


// Get current window handle
        String parentWinHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
        System.out.println("Parent window handle: " + parentWinHandle);


//Dealing with Multiple Handlers 
Set<String> winHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
        // Loop through all handles
        for(String handle: winHandles){
            if(!handle.equals(parentWinHandle)){
            driver.switchTo().window(handle);
            Thread.sleep(1000);


====================================================================================================
Java Packages -contains classes and Interfaces

Finalise --Used with Garbage collector ,method called before GC to run clean up -means to close the resources asscoiated with objects like DB / netwrok connectn 
It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses. 
finalize() method in Java
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.

Abstarct class and Interface Diff ==========class extends/Implements interface ============does Interface extends/Implements Interface

==========================================================================================================================================================
Why multiple Inheritance not possible in java --Diamond Problem 
Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

===========================================================================================================================================
Q15. Define a Java Class.
A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object. Let’s have a look at the syntax of a class.

class Abc {
member variables /

Q:Status codes for API ?
200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.

501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 

500 (Internal Server Error)

415 (Unsupported Media Type)

412 (Precondition Failed)

404 (Not Found)

401 (Unauthorized)

201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 

301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Suppose there are 2 @Before and 2 @Aftr methods then how will you manage which before to run firsta nd which later on 

Ans : @Before(order=2)        -this will run first

	@After(order=1)        -this will run first 
	@After(order=2)			-then it will run second 
	
	Note : before mein order ulta rahega

Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Difference in hooks and background 

Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in a single feature. A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps. The difference is when it is run. 

================>The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your Before Hooks<===================

Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy.They are typically used for setup and tear down of the environment before and after each scenario.


Use Background only to setup a pre-condition that the user needs to know.

Q:Mention why to choose Python over Java in Selenium?

Few points that favor Python over Java to use with Selenium is,

Java programs tend to run slower compared to Python programs.
Java uses traditional braces to start and ends blocks, while Python uses indentation.
Java employs static typing, while Python is dynamically typed.
Python is simpler and more compact compared to Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: what is desired capability? How is it useful in terms of Selenium?

The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?

Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened

What are verification and validation?
Verification is a process of evaluating software at the development phase. It helps you to decide whether the product of a given application satisfies the specified requirements. Validation is the process of evaluating software at the after the development process and to check whether it meets the customer requirements.
===========================================================================================================================================
Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Java static block ?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader. It is used to initialize static variables of the class. Mostly it’s used to create static resources when class is loaded.

Q:Q:Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Test(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)

What is the difference between @Factory and @Data Provider annotation?
Answer: @DataProvider is concerned with individual test methods and run the specific methods for many times. @Factory method creates test class instances and runs all the test methods in that class with different data. sets.

===========================================================================================================================================
8. Is null a keyword?
Answer:No, the null is not a keyword.
===========================================================================================================================================
Factory and @DataProvider annotation
TestNG Factory is useful when you want to run multiple test classes through a single test class.
Example 

public class Test1 {

	@Test
	public void test1() {
		System.out.println("Test1 test method");
	}
}


public class Test2 {

	@Test
	public void test2() {
		System.out.println("Test2 test method");
	}
}


Public class TestNGFactory {

	@Factory()
	public Object[] getTestClasses() {
		Object[] tests = new Object[2];
		tests[0] = new Test1();
		tests[1] = new Test2();
		return tests;
	}

TestNG generates two types of reports by default after the execution of all the test methods finishes. They are:

Emailable Reports
Index Reports
===========================================================================================================================================
Where is the emailable report generated and saved in TestNG?
Emailable reports generate under the project folder and test-output subfolder. This report is available as “emailable-report.html” by default.

Where is the index report generated and saved in TestNG?
The index report generates under the project folder and test-output subfolder. Moreover, this report is available as “index.html” by default.

Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?

The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one
Singletons often control access to resources, such as database connections or sockets.

Example :  you have a license for only one connection for your database or your JDBC driver has trouble with multithreading, the Singleton makes sure that only one connection is made or that only one thread can access the connection at a time.

Creating Singleton class ==>
To design a singleton class:
1.Make constructor as private.
2.Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.

Normal class vs Singleton class: Difference in normal and singleton class in terms of instantiation is that, For normal class we use constructor, whereas for singleton class we use getInstance() method

--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;

Q:Selenium webdriver archietecture ?

Selenium Client Library
JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client
Browser Drivers
Browsers

1. Selenium Client Libraries/Language Bindings

Selenium supports multiple libraries such as Java, Ruby, Python, etc. Selenium Developers have developed language bindings to allow Selenium to support multiple languages. If you wish to know more about libraries, kindly refer to the official site for Selenium libraries.

2. JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to transfer data between a server and a client on the web. JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP server. Each BrowserDriver (such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, etc.) has its own HTTP server.

3. Browser Drivers

Each browser contains a separate browser driver. Browser drivers communicate with the respective browser without revealing the internal logic of the browser’s functionality. When a browser driver has received any command then that command will be executed on the respective browser and the response will go back in the form of an HTTP response.

4. Browsers

Selenium supports multiple browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, etc.


Explanation
WebDriver driver  = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");

Once you are ready with your script, you will click on Run to execute the program. Based on the above statements, the Firefox browser will be launched and it will navigate to Edureka website.

Once you click on ‘Run’, every statement in your script will be converted as a URL, with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP. The URL’s will be passed to the Browser Drivers. (In the above code, I have used FirefoxDriver). Here, in this case, the client library (Java) will convert the statements of the script into JSON format and further communicate with the FirefoxDriver. 

Every Browser Driver uses an HTTP server to receive HTTP requests. Once the URL reaches the Browser Driver, then it will pass that request to the real browser over HTTP. Once done, the commands in your Selenium script will be executed on the browser. In the case of Chrome browser, you can write your Selenium script as shown below:

WebDriver driver  = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");
If the request is POST request, then there will be an action on the browser. If the request is a GET request then the corresponding response will be generated at the browser end. It will be then sent over HTTP to the browser driver and the Browser Driver over JSON Wire Protocol and sends it to the UI (Eclipse IDE).

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

74. What is a Defect?
The variation between the actual results and expected results is known as a defect. If a developer finds an issue and corrects it by himself in the development phase then it’s called a defect. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75. What is a Bug?

If testers find any mismatch in the application/system in testing phase then they call it as Bug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76. What is an Error?
We can’t compile or run a program due to a coding mistake in a program. If a developer unable to successfully compile or run a program then they call it as an error. 

77. What is a Failure?
Once the product is deployed and customers find any issues then they call the product as a failure product. After release, if an end user finds an issue then that particular issue is called as a failure. Click here for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) What are the important tasks in Test Planning phase? Important tasks in Test planning phase are: 
i) Understanding and Analyzing the Requirements 
ii) Risk Analysis
iii) Test Strategy Implementation 
iv) Test Estimations (Scope, Time, Resources, Budget etc…) 
v) Team Formation 
vi) Test Plan Documentation 
vii) Configuration Management Planning 
viii) Traceability Matrix documentation 
ix) Define Test Environment Setup

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is bug leakage and bug release? 
Bug Leakage: A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that bug (which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage. 

Bug release: Releasing the software to the Production with some known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note. In other case, releasing the software to the testing team with some known bugs whose severity and priority is low. These bugs can be removed before releasing to production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Suppose there is a functionality in the application , which has got some changes - now is it nessecary to do complete regression testing .What else can be done in this case ?

Ans - In this case based on the impact this feature has on the other feature , the testing can be done and yes ,no need to do complete regression testing if there is time constaint.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Bucket Testing?
Bucket testing is a method to compare two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is static block?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader.It is used to initialize static variables of the class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Is it possible to write multiple catch blocks under a single try block?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to write several catch blocks under a single try block. However, the approach needs to be from specific to general. Following example demonstrates the same:

public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?

Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened
Report: Report the issues to higher level manager
Control: Define the issue management process

    elements.get(i).click(); */
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Is it possible to interact with hidden elements using WebDriver?
Selenium has been specifically written to NOT allow interaction with hidden elements. ... However, Selenium does allow you to execute Javascript within the context of an element, so you could write Javascript to perform the click event even if it is hidden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is WebElement an interface or a class -----Interface , The WebElement interface is implemented by AndroidWebElement, HtmlUnitWebElement, or RemoteWebElement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is the difference between dragAndDrop() and dragAndDropBy()?
The dragAndDrop() method is similar to dragAndDropBy() method. The only difference between them is that we move the cursor to WebElement by an offset in dragAndDropBy() method, whereas, in dragAndDrop() method, we directly move the cursor on target WebElement. ... The return type of both methods is Actions class.

Q:Can we declare a final global variable and use it without initializing it? -----No

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Before and Before Class

@BeforeClass :: Execute before all test methods of the class are executed.Used with static method.                                                 ¦              ¦             ¦
¦ For example, This method could contain some initialization code 

@Before :Execute before each test method. Used with non-static method.

Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )
public class FailedScenarios {

Java Database Connectivity(JDBC) is a Java API which is used to connect and interact with Database.

Establishing connection ::
DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Employee","root","root");

URL contains "jdbc(main protocol):mysql(sub protocol for mySql)://localhost:3306(sub name for mysql (host:prot))/Employee(database)" and this method return type is Connection Object ie.,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status codes for API ::

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.

501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 

500 (Internal Server Error)

415 (Unsupported Media Type)

412 (Precondition Failed)

404 (Not Found)

401 (Unauthorized)

201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 

301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Ans: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework
Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Examples:
|filename|
|file1|
|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
#18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

===============================================================================================================
Q #15) What is meant by Interface?
All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
The class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix
===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===========================================================Starts from here 1/21/21====================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.

What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is data encapsulation and what's its significance?

Ans: Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit.
Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.

Advantage - no one can our class data , the outside class can use the variables (private) whihc we have made setter and getter 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?

Ans: Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn't have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is same origin policy? How you can avoid same origin policy?

The “Same Origin Policy” is introduced for security reason, and it ensures that content of your site will never be accessible by a script from another site.  As per the policy, any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website’s domain.

To avoid “Same Origin Policy” proxy injection method is used, in proxy injection mode the Selenium Server acts as a client configured HTTP proxy , which sits between the browser and application under test and then masks the AUT under a fictional URL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is JavaScriptExecutor and in which cases JavaScriptExecutor will help in Selenium automation?
In general, we click on an element using click() method in Selenium.

For example:

driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
1
driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
Sometimes web controls don’t react well against selenium commands and we may face issues with the above statement (click()). To overcome such kind of situation, we use JavaScriptExecutor interface.

Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Before and Before Class

@BeforeClass :: Execute before all test methods of the class are executed.Used with static method.                                                 ¦              ¦             ¦
¦ For example, This method could contain some initialization code 

@Before :Execute before each test method. Used with non-static method.

===================================================================================================================================
Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",

              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

25) Explain what are test driver and test stub and why it is required?
The stub is called from the software component to be tested. It is used in top down approach
The driver calls a component to be tested. It is used in bottom up approach
It is required when we need to test the interface between modules X and Y and we have developed only module X. So we cannot just test module X but if there is any dummy module we can use that dummy module to test module X
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Ans: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework
Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Examples:
|filename|
|file1|
|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.

59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}

Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}

int =1;
while(i>0){
system.out.printn("");
}

==================================================================================================================================

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.
==================================================================================================================================
13) While using click command can you use screen coordinate? 
To click on specific part of element, you would need to use clickAT command.  ClickAt command accepts element locator and x, y co-ordinates as arguments- clickAt (locator, cordString)
===========================================================================================================================================
What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.
===========================================================================================================================================
What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

===========================================================================================================================================
What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Difference between extends Thread vs implements Runnable in Java? (detailed answer)
The difference comes from the fact that you can only extend one class in Java, which means if you extend the Thread class you lose your opportunity to extend another class, on the other hand, if you implement Runnable, you can still extend another class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is the difference between wait and notify in Java? (detailed answer)
Both wait and notify methods are used for inter-thread communication, where the wait is used to pause the thread on a condition, and notify is used to send a notification to waiting threads. Both must be called from synchronized context e.g. synchronized method or block.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between error and exception in java?

Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Can we keep other statements in between try, catch and finally blocks?

No. We shouldn’t write any other statements in between try, catch and finally blocks. They form a one unit.

try
{
    // Statements to be monitored for exceptions
}
  
//You can't keep statements here
  
catch(Exception ex)
{
    //Cathcing the exceptions here
}
  
//You can't keep statements here
  
finally
{
    // This block is always executed
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) What are run time exceptions in java. Give example?

The exceptions which occur at run time are called as run time exceptions. These exceptions are unknown to compiler. All sub classes of java.lang.RunTimeException and java.lang.Error are run time exceptions. These exceptions are unchecked type of exceptions. For example, NumberFormatException, NullPointerException, ClassCastException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, StackOverflowError etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) Does finally block get executed If either try or catch blocks are returning the control?

Yes, finally block will be always executed no matter whether try or catch blocks are returning the control or not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15) Can we throw an exception manually? If yes, how?

Yes, we can throw an exception manually using throw keyword. Syntax for throwing an exception manually is

throw InstanceOfThrowableType;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) Why it is always recommended that clean up operations like closing the DB resources to keep inside a finally block?

Because finally block is always executed whether exceptions are raised in the try block or not and raised exceptions are caught in the catch block or not. By keeping the clean up operations in finally block, you will ensure that those operations will be always executed irrespective of whether exception is occurred or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19) What is the difference between final, finally and finalize in java?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26) Which class is the super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java?

java.lang.Throwable is the super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29) Give some examples to checked exceptions?

ClassNotFoundException, SQLException, IOException

30) Give some examples to unchecked exceptions?

NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NumberFormatException

Q:Upcasting and down casting in java---upcasting is converting smaller data type to big data type like int to long 
Q: Is map a part of collection? What is hashmap?---stores values in key , value pair 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class TestNG {
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 
 @Test (priority = 0)
 public void CloseBrowser() {
 driver.close();
 System.out.println("Closing Google Chrome browser");
 }
 
 @Test (priority = -1)
 public void OpenBrowser() {
 System.out.println("Launching Google Chrome browser");         
 driver.get("https://www.demoqa.com");
 }
 
 @Test
 public void AccountTest(){
 System.out.println("Some tests for Customer Account");
 }
}


Answer - first -1 priority wale method will run ---> then Account test wala and at last 0 prioty wala
Observe that the AccountTest method ran before CloseBrowser even without having any priority because both sets to priority = 0, and hence, they run alphabetically.

*Question*
Why Selenium script runs slow on IE browser as compared to other browsers like chrome and Firefox



*Answer*
Much of the functionality of WebDriver is implemented using so-called "automation atoms". These are JavaScript functions that are used to ensure consistency and reduce maintenance across the different drivers. Some of these functions are fairly straightforward, and delegate down to the browsers' native code fairly quickly. Finding an element by ID, for example, pretty clearly translates to document.getElementById().

Other operations, on the other hand, are much more computationally expensive. For example, getting the text of an element is one of the most expensive things you can do, Because of the way the WebDriver API defines getting an elements text.

Because so much of this functionality is built in JavaScript, a browser that has a slow JavaScript engine like IE Will show poor performance when executing WebDriver code. Remember that the JavaScript engine in IE before version 9 was about ten times slower than the JavaScript engines in Firefox and Chrome. IE9 introduced a new JavaScript engine that was a lot closer in performance to that of Firefox and Chrome, but Microsoft only implemented the new JavaScript engine in the 32-bit version of IE. So the first thing you can do is run your tests against the 32-bit version of IE9.

IE also doesn't have a native XPath engine for finding elements. So to be able to find elements by XPath in IE, we have to use a JavaScript XPath query engine. That's going to be slower than doing the same thing in other browsers. This is the biggest reason why I recommend using CSS selectors instead of XPath for finding elements.

I would also recommend calling expensive methods as seldom as possible. The two most expensive methods are getText() and isDisplayed(), because they have to walk a substantial portion of the DOM tree before they can return the correct value.

1. What is Java?
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. 
Platform independent and is based on OOPS .
 Java is easy to learn
Everything in Java is an Object.


Q1. What is the difference between an Inner Class and a Sub-Class?

Ans: An Inner class is a class which is nested within another class. An Inner class has access rights for the class which is nesting it and it can access all variables and methods defined in the outer class.
A sub-class is a class which inherits from another class called super class. Sub-class can access all public and protected methods and fields of its super class. 



Q3. What's the purpose of Static methods and static variables?
When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method or variable shared for all objects. 


Q4. What is data encapsulation and what's its significance?
Ans: Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit.

Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose. 



Q5. What is a singleton class? Give a practical example of its usage.
A singleton class in java can have only one instance and hence all its methods and variables belong to just one instance. Singleton class concept is useful for the situations when there is a need to limit the number of objects for a class. 
The best example of singleton usage scenario is when there is a limit of having only one connection to a database due to some driver limitations or because of any licensing issues


Q8. What is the difference between continue and break statement?
break and continue are two important keywords used in Loops. When a break keyword is used in a loop, loop is broken instantly while when continue keyword is used, current iteration is broken and loop continues with next iteration. 



Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 


Q12: How can you generate random numbers in Java?
Using Math.random() 




Q15. Can main() method in Java can return any data?
In java, main() method can't return any data and hence, it's always declared with a void return type. 



Q17. Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?
Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn't have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error. 



Q19. What are the performance implications of Interfaces over abstract classes?
Interfaces are slower in performance as compared to abstract classes as extra indirections are required for interfaces. Another key factor for developers to take into consideration is that any class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement many interfaces. 


Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required. 




Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 



Q27. When the constructor of a class is invoked?
The constructor of a class is invoked every time an object is created with new keyword.



Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?
We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).



Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 



Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.



Q42. Can a class be a super class and a sub-class at the same time? Give example.
Yes , inheritance 




Q43. How objects of a class are created if no constructor is defined in the class?
 Even if no explicit constructor is defined in a java class, objects get created successfully as a default constructor is implicitly used for object creation. This constructor has no parameters. 



Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 



Q46. There are two classes named classA and classB. Both classes are in the same package. Can a private member of classA can be accessed by an object of classB?
Private members of a class aren't accessible outside the scope of that class and any other class even in the same package can't access them. 




Q47. Can we have two methods in a class with the same name?
We can define two methods in a class with the same name but with different number/type of parameters. Which method is to get invoked will depend upon the parameters passed. 


Q52. How can we restrict inheritance for a class so that no class can be inherited from it?
If we want a class not to be extended further by any class, we can use the keyword Final with the class name. 



Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. 



57. Which types of exceptions are caught at compile time?
Checked exceptions can be caught at the time of program compilation. Checked exceptions must be handled by using try catch block in the code in order to successfully compile the code. 



Q62. Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 




Q63. What are the two environment variables that must be set in order to run any Java programs?  \
PATH variable
CLASSPATH variable


Q64. Can variables be used in Java without initialization?
In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn't compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java. 


Q:Can a constructor have different name than a Class name in Java?
Constructor in Java must have same name as the class name and if the name is different, it doesn't act as a constructor and compiler thinks of it as a normal method. 


Q71. Is JDK required on each machine to run a Java program?
JDK is development Kit of Java and is required for development only and to run a Java program on a machine, JDK isn't required. Only JRE is required.



Q3. What is the difference between Declaration and Definition in Java?
Declaration: If you just declare a class or method/function or variable without mentioning anything about what that class or method/function or variable looks like is called as declaration in Java.

Definition: If you define how a class or method/function or variable is implemented then it is called definition in Java.

When we create an interface or abstract class, we simply declare a method/function but not define it.



What is Local Variable and Instance Variable?
Local variable is a variable which we declare inside a Method. A method will often store its temporary state in local variables.

Instance variable is a variable which is declared inside a Class but outside a Method. We don’t declare this variable as Static because these variables are non-static variables


What are the OOPs concepts?
OOPS Stands for Object Oriented Programming System. It includes Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interface etc.,


11. What are the types of Polymorphism?
1. Compile time polymorphism (Static binding) – Method overloading
2. Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic binding) – Method overriding



12. What is Method Overloading?
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading

There are three ways to overload a method.
    Parameters with different data types
    Parameters with different sequence of a data types
    Different number of parameters


13. What is Method Overriding?
Declaring a method in child class which is already present in the parent class is called Method Overriding.
In simple words, overriding means to override the functionality of an existing method.
Method overriding happens if the sub class method satisfies the below conditions with the Super class method:

    Method name should be same
    Argument should be same
    Return type also should be same




14. What is Abstraction in Java?
Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation of internal details and showing the functionality to the users.
The method which has only the declaration and not the implementation is called the abstract method and it has the keyword called “abstract”. Declarations are the ends with a semicolon.

==public abstract void add();//Abstract method declaration


Example: Mobile Phone.
A layman who is using mobile phone doesn’t know how it works internally but he can make phone calls.




17. What is Interface in Java?
An interface in Java looks similar to a class but both the interface and class are two different concepts. An interface can have methods and variables just like the class but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract



18. What is Encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit. Let’s take an example of Capsule. Different powdered or liquid medicines are encapsulated inside a capsule.

Purpose of Encapsulation:
    Protects the code from others.
    Code maintainability.



21. How to reverse a String in Java?
StringBuffer a = new StringBuffer("Software Testing Material");
 // use reverse() method to reverse string
 System.out.println(a.reverse());



Q #3) How does Java enable high performance?
Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. JIT is used to convert the instructions into bytecodes.



Q #14) What is meant by Overloading?
For method overloading, subclass method should satisfy the below conditions with the Super class method (or) methods in the same class itself:

    Same method name
    Different argument type
    May have different return types



Q:String and String Buffer ??
String: String variables are stored in “constant string pool”. Once the string reference changes the old value that exists in the “constant string pool”, it cannot be erased.
Example : String name = “book”;

String Buffer:
Here string values are stored in a stack. If the values are changed then the new value replaces the older value.
Performance is slower than the String Builder.

StringBuffer SF = "I Love You";
sysout.println(SF.reverse());


Q:Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.



Q #23) Difference between Abstract class and Interface.
Abstract Class:

    Abstract classes have a default constructor and it is called whenever the concrete subclass is instantiated.
    Contains Abstract methods as well as Non-Abstract methods.
    The class which extends the Abstract class shouldn’t require implementing all the methods, only Abstract methods need to be implemented in the concrete sub-class.
    Abstract Class contains instance variables.

Interface:

    Doesn’t have any constructor and couldn’t be instantiated.
    Abstract method alone should be declared.
    Classes which implement the interface should provide the implementation for all the methods.
    The interface contains only constants.



Q #31) What is mean by Exception?

Ans: An Exception is a problem that can occur during the normal flow of an execution. A method can throw an exception when something wails at runtime. If that exception couldn’t be handled, then the execution gets terminated before it completes the task.

Two types of Exceptions are explained below in detail.
Checked Exception:

These exceptions are checked by the compiler at the time of compilation. Classes that extend Throwable class except Runtime exception and Error are called checked Exception.


Unchecked Exception:

These exceptions are not checked during the compile time by the compiler.  The compiler doesn’t force to handle these exceptions.
It includes:

    Arithmetic Exception
    ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception






Q #33) What are the different ways to handle exceptions?

Ans: Two different ways to handle exception are explained below:
Using try/catch:
A risky code is surrounded by try block. If an exception occurs, then it is caught by the catch block which is followed by the try block.



Q #37) What is the final keyword in Java?
Once a variable is declared as final, then the value of the variable could not be changed. It is like a constant.
A final keyword in a method that couldn’t be overridden. If a method is marked as a final, then it can’t be overridden by the subclass.
If a class is declared as final, then the class couldn’t be subclassed. No class can extend the final class.



Q #38) What is a Thread?
IKn Java, the flow of a execution is called Thread. Every java program has at least one thread called main thread, the Main thread is created by JVM. 

public static void main(String[] args)
{//main thread starts here
    }



Q #3) What all things can you automate?
    Regression test suite

    Identify the reusable methods and write it in a separate file.
    Follow the language-specific coding conventions.
    Maintain the test data in a separate file.
    Run your scripts regularly.



Q #24) What is an Automation testing framework?
Answer: A framework, in general, is a set of guidelines. A set of guidelines, assumptions, concepts and coding practices for creating an execution environment in which the tests will be automated, is known as an Automation testing framework.

An automation testing framework is responsible for creating a test harness with a mechanism to connect with the application under test, take input from a file, execute the test cases and generate the reports for test execution. An automation testing framework should be independent of the application and it should be easy to use, modify or extend.



Q #26) Explain some Automation testing tools.
Selenium
UFT
QTP
Appium 
Cucumber-ucumber is an open source behavior-driven development tool. It is used for web-based application automation testing and supports languages like ruby, java, scala, groovy etc. Cucumber reads executable specification written in plain text and tests the application under test for those specifications.



Modular Testing framework: 
This framework is built on the concept of abstraction. In this framework, the tester creates scripts for each module of the application under test individually and then these scripts are combined in the hierarchical order to create large test cases.

It creates an abstraction layer between the modules, thus any modifications in test scripts for one module do not affect any other modules.

=Keyword-Driven Testing framework:

It is an application independent testing framework which uses data tables and self-explanatory keywords. Keywords explain the actions to be performed on the application under test and data table provides the input and expected output data.


Q #30) List some advantages and disadvantages of Automation testing.
Advantages:

    Fewer Human resources
    Reusability
    More Test Coverage in less time
    Reliability
    Parallel execution of test cases
    Fast

Disadvantages:

    Development and maintenance time is more.
    Tool Cost
    Skilled resources are required.
    Environment setup
    Test Script debugging is an issue.



Q #3) Why should Selenium be selected as a test tool?
    is a free and open source
    have a large user base and helping communities
    have cross Browser compatibility (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.)
    have great platform compatibility (Windows, Mac OS, Linux etc.)
    supports multiple programming languages (Java, C#, Ruby, Python, Pearl etc.)
    has fresh and regular repository developments
    supports distributed testing


Q #9) What is Selenese?
Selenese is the language which is used to write test scripts in Selenium IDE.
Types : Action , accesors and assertion 


Q #15) When should I use Selenium Grid?
Selenium Grid can be used to execute same or different test scripts on multiple platforms and browsers concurrently so as to achieve distributed test execution, testing under different environments and saving execution time remarkably.

selectByValue.selectByValue(“greenvalue”);

//selectByIndex:
//selectByVisibleText:


Q #27) How to handle frame in WebDriver?
driver.switchTo().frame(“ID of the frame“);

tagName
index
Name of Frame


Q #31) Can Selenium handle windows based pop up?
Selenium is an automation testing tool which supports only web application testing. Therefore, windows pop up cannot be handled using Selenium.
There are several third-party tools available for handling window based pop-ups along with the selenium like AutoIT, Robot class etc.



Q #34) How to assert title of the web page?
Assert.asserttitle("Tile is ",driver.getTitle().equal."hello");


Q #38) What is Junit?
Junit is a unit testing framework introduced by Apache. Junit is based on Java.


Q #40) What is TestNG and how is it better than Junit?
TestNG is an advanced framework designed in a way to leverage the benefits by both the developers and testers. With the commencement of the frameworks, JUnit gained an enormous popularity across the Java applications, Java developers and Java testers with remarkably increasing the code quality. Despite being easy to use and straightforward, JUnit has its own limitations which give rise to the need of bringing TestNG into the picture. TestNG is an open source framework which is distributed under the Apache Software License and is readily available for download.

    Added advance and easy annotations
    Execution patterns can set
    Concurrent execution of test scripts
    Test case dependencies can be set


Q #41) How to set test case priority in TestNG?
@Test(priority=0)




==>Framework ::
Behavior Driven Development Framework: Behavior Driven Development framework allows automation of functional validations in easily readable and understandable format to Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, etc.

Module Based Testing Framework: The framework divides the entire “Application Under Test” into the number of logical and isolated modules. For each module, we create a separate and independent test script. Thus, when these test scripts taken together builds a larger test script representing more than one module.

Data Driven Testing Framework: Data Driven Testing Framework helps the user segregate the test script logic and the test data from each other. It lets the user store the test data into an external database. The data is conventionally stored in “Key-Value” pairs. Thus, the key can be used to access and populate the data within the test scripts.

Keyword Driven Testing Framework: The Keyword Driven testing framework is an extension to Data-driven Testing Framework in a sense that it not only segregates the test data from the scripts, it also keeps the certain set of code belonging to the test script into an external data file.


Hybrid Testing Framework: Hybrid Testing Framework is a combination of more than one above mentioned frameworks. The best thing about such a setup is that it leverages the benefits of all kinds of associated frameworks.



Q #45) How can I read test data from excels?
Test data can efficiently be read from excel using JXL or POI API.


Q #2) What language is used by Cucumber?
 Gherkin is the language that is used by the Cucumber tool. It is a simple English representation of the application behavior. Gherkin language uses several keywords to describe the behavior of application such as Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, When, Then etc.



Q #3) What is meant by a feature file?
A feature file must provide a high-level description of an Application Under Test (AUT). The first line of the feature file must start with the keyword ‘Feature’ following the description of the application under test.
A feature file may include multiple scenarios within the same file. A feature file has the extension .feature.


Q #5) What is the purpose of Scenario Outline in Cucumber?
Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.


Q #6) What programming language is used by Cucumber?
Java, .Net, Ruby etc



Q #7) What is the purpose of Step Definition file in Cucumber?
Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.
While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.


Q #11) What is the purpose of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) methodology in the real world?
The main aim of Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, Support Team understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.



Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?
Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.


Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?
Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file



Q #16) What is the file extension for a feature file?
File Extension for a feature file is .feature


Q #18) What is the purpose of Cucumber Options tag?
Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. 


Q #19) How can Cucumber be integrated with Selenium WebDriver?
    cucumber-core-1.2.2.jar
    cucumber-java-1.2.2.jar
    cucumber-junit-1.2.2.jar
    cucumber-jvm-deps-1.0.3.jar
    cucumber-reporting-0.1.0.jar
    gherkin-2.12.2.jar


Q #21) Provide an example of Background keyword in Cucumber.
Background: Given user is on the application login page.




Q:Difference in Automation testing/Tester and SDET (Software Design Engineer in test)
Automation Testing can be referred to role/designation as well as it is the term use to differentiate between Manual Testing and Automation Testing. You can say that I am in Automation Testing, I am Automation Tester, I am a Test Developer,Test Automation proffessional etc. But yes when it comes to the term SDET(Software Development/Design Engineer in Test) This refers to a role which has expertise in below aspects of Automation Testing (not mandatorily all but most of it):

Automation Framework Designing-Selenium, Cucumber, Siquili, AutoIT, RPM, Rest-Assured API, OK HTTP, etc

Coding/Scripting (Java,C#, Python, Pearl, Ruby etc)

CICD pipeline (continuous Integration Continuous Development/Delivery)- Jenkins, Maven,Bamboo etc. DevOps tools and practices -GitHub, Ansible, Docker etc.

Apart from all above, SDET must also be aware of QA practices, Like Agile, Waterfall, STLC SDLC, defect lifecycle, Diff Types of Testings, Testing situational dealings, Test Plan and artifacts etc.
==================================================================================================================================================================
Why is it better to use explicitly wait rather than implicitly wait in Selenium Web Driver?

Implicit Wait in Selenium is the default wait that will be applicable for finding all the Web elements that are used as part of test script execution.Even though the WEB Element is available in the DOM of the Web Page within the time limit specified in the implicit Wait,driver will still wait until the time is completed to act upon the Web Element.On Contrary, Explicit Wait will wait for the presence of Web Element in the DOM and if once the element is available in the DOM it will act up on the element immediately.We Can also specify the conditions in the Explicit Wait like WaitUntillElementisDisplayed,WaitUntilElementisClickable etc.

Also one major difference between these two waits is once you specify Implicit Wait in your Script it will be applicable to all the findElement and findElements statements in the scripts which will slow down your execution time.where as Explicit Wait is only applicable to single WebElement/WebElements that you specify while declaring the Explicit Wait.

Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Throw and Throws 

throw keyword is used inside a function. It is used when it is required to throw an Exception logically.
filter_none

brightness_4
void Demo() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException 
{ 
// Statements where exceptions might occur. 
throw new ArithmeticException(); 
} 
throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly. It can throw only one exception at a time.


Throws :
throws keyword is in the function signature. It is used when the function has some statements that can lead to some exceptions.
throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by comma. Whichever exception occurs, if matched with the declared ones, is thrown automatically then.

/ throwing multiple exceptions 
void Demo() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException 
{ 
// Statements where exceptions might occur. 
} 


********************************************************************************************
Throw & Throws :

    Both keywords are used in exception handling(which handle run time errors)
    The keywords itself described about differences


Throw:

    This is a keywords used to hit the exception in the block of the program(Inside the block of code )
    Throw hits a single exception at the run time but it can throw any exception type like arithmetic exception,numeric exception,sql exception etc
Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.
Throw is used within the method.
You cannot throw multiple exceptions.



Throws:

    Throws is also keyword which lies outside the block
    Which handle one or more exceptions
    But we should mention the type of exception in adjacent to throws keyword
Throws is followed by class.
Throws is used with the method signature.
You can declare multiple exceptions e.g. public void method()throws IOException, SQLException.
==================================================================================================  101. What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration is abbreviated as CI. Continuous Integration is a development practice which aims to make sure the correctness of a software. After each commit, a suite of tests run automatically and test the software to ensure whether the software is running without any breaks. If any test fails, we will get immediate feedback say “build is broken”.

In simple words, continuous integration is a process of verifying the correctness of a software.

Some of the continuous integration tools are Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, Travis, Circle Ci, Bitbucket.
================================================================
ues.28. Explain the different types of specification based test design technique?
Ans. Specification based test design techniques are also referred to as blackbox testing. It involves testing based on the specification of the system under test without knowing its internal architecture. The different types of specification based test design or black box testing techniques are-

    Equivalence partitioning - Grouping test data into logical groups or equivalence classes with the assumpation that all the data items lying in the classes will     have same effect on the application.
    Boundary value analysis - Testing using the boundary values of the equivalence classes taken as the test input.
    Decision tables - Testing using decision tables showing application's behaviour based on different combination of input values.
    Cause-effect graph - Testing using graphical representation of input i.e. cause and output i.e. effect is used for test designing.
    State transition testing - Testing based on state machine model.
    Use case testing - Testing carried out using use cases.user action and system response.


Ques.34. What is use case testing?
Ans. A use case testing is a black box testing approach in which testing is carried out using use cases. A use case scenario is seen as interaction between the application and actors(users).



Ques.41). What are the different types of Integration testing?
Ans. The different type of integration testing are-

    Big bang Integration Testing - In big bang integration testing, testing starts only after all the modules are integrated.
    Top-down Integration Testing - In top down integration, testing/integration starts from top modules to lower level modules.
    Bottom-up Integration Testing - In bottom up integration, testing starts from lower level modules to higher level module up in the heirarchy.
    Hybrid Integration Testing - Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom up integration testing. In this approach, the integration         starts from middle layer and testing is carried out in both the direction

4. What is exception test in Selenium?

An exception test is an exception that you expect will be thrown inside a test class. If you have written a test case in such way that it should throw an exception, then you can use the @Test annotation and specify which exception you will be expecting by mentioning it in the parameters. Take a look at the example below: @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class)
--Do note the syntax, where the exception is suffixed with .class

    }
 
 
    //Method take string parameter and check string is empty or not
    public static String reverseString(String myStr)
    {
        if (myStr.isEmpty()){
         System.out.println("String in now Empty");    
         return myStr;
        }
        //Calling Function Recursively
        System.out.println("String to be passed in Recursive Function: "+myStr.substring(1));
        return reverseString(myStr.substring(1)) + myStr.charAt(0);
    }

Ques.4. What is Quality Assurance?
Ans. Quality assurance is a process driven approach which checks if the process of developing the product is correct and conforming to all the standards. It is considered as a preventive measure as it identifies the weakness in the process to build a software. It involves activites like document review, test cases review, walkthroughs, inspection etc.---Verification

Ques.5. What is Quality Control?
Ans. Quality control is product driven approach which checks that the developed product conforms to all the specified requirements. It is considered as a corrective measure as it tests the built product to find the defects. It involves different types of testing includes actual execution  like functional testing, performance testing, usability testing etc.---validation

Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}

Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q #38) What is a Thread?
IKn Java, the flow of a execution is called Thread. Every java program has at least one thread called main thread, the Main thread is created by JVM. 

public static void main(String[] args)
{//main thread starts here
    }
****Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.
----------------------------------------------------
99. What is Test Metrics?
Software test metrics is to monitor and control process and product. It helps to drive the project towards our planned goals without deviation.
----------------------------------------------------
24) When we choose Informal Testing?
 Whenever we don’t have proper documentation (Requirements etc…) and not have sufficient Time then we choose Informal Testing. Using Experienced based Techniques (Ex: Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing etc…) we conduct Testing.
----------------------------------------------------
100. What is desired capabilities?
In Selenium we use desired capabilities to handle SSL certificates in chrome browser
We need to create an instance of DesiredCapabilities
DesiredCapabilities desiredCapability = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
desired capabilities are used for chrome , for firefox we use firefox options 
----------------------------------------------------
1. What is the difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)? 
Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the process used to make Software Application. So the defects don’t arise when the Software Application is being developed. Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the defects in the Software Application
----------------------------------------------------

2. What is the difference between Preventative and Reactive approaches in testing? 
Preventive approach: It is also known as Verification Process. This approach is to prevent defects. In this approach, tests are designed at early stages of SDLC i.e., before the software has been produced. Here in this approach testers try to prevent defects in the early stages. It comes under Quality Analysis (QA). 

Reactive approach: It is also known as Validation Process. This approach is to identify defects. In this approach, tests are designed to execute after the software has been produced. Here we try to find defects. It comes under Quality Control (QC).
----------------------------------------------------
10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include?
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base
----------------------------------------------------
19. What is the difference between build and release?
 Build: A build is a version of a software. Every build has a number for identification purpose. Build is a pre-release version of a Release. Build is given to testing team by developers to test the application locally. Build numbers are incremental. Release: A release is the distribution of the final version of an application to the customer by software development team. 
----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
64. Who takes this decision? 
A. The Test Manager
----------------------------------------------------
96) Mention what is desired capability? How is it useful in terms of Selenium?
The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
desired capabalities are for chrome and for furefox we use firfoxoptions  
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.88. How can we pass parameter to test script using testNG?
Ans. Using @Parameter annotation and 'parameter' tag in testng.xml we can pass parameters to the test script
Sample testng.xml -

<suite name="sampleTestSuite">
   <test name="sampleTest">   
      <parameter name="sampleParamName" value="sampleParamValue"/>
      <classes>
         <class name="TestFile" />

Sample test script-

public class TestFile {
   @Test
   @Parameters("sampleParamName")
   public void parameterTest(String paramValue) {
webElement userName = driver.findElement(****).sendkeys("paramValue");
      System.out.println("Value of sampleParamName is - " + sampleParamName);
   }

----------------------------------------------------
What are some commonly encountered exceptions in selenium?
    NoSuchElementException - When no element could be located from the locator provided.
    ElementNotVisibleException - When element is present in the dom but is not visible.
    NoAlertPresentException - When we try to switch to an alert but the targetted alert is not present.
    NoSuchFrameException - When we try to switch to a frame but the targetted frame is not present.
    NoSuchWindowException - When we try to switch to a window but the targetted window is not present.

    WebDriverException - When there is some issue with driver instance preventing it from getting launched.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.4. What is Quality Assurance?
Ans. Quality assurance is a process driven approach which checks if the process of developing the product is correct and conforming to all the standards. It is considered as a preventive measure as it identifies the weakness in the process to build a software. It involves activites like document review, test cases review, walkthroughs, inspection etc.---Verification

Ques.5. What is Quality Control?
Ans. Quality control is product driven approach which checks that the developed product conforms to all the specified requirements. It is considered as a corrective measure as it tests the built product to find the defects. It involves different types of testing includes actual execution  like functional testing, performance testing, usability testing etc.---validation
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.20. What is defect density?
Ans. Defect density is the measure of density of the defects in the system. It can be calculated by dividing number of defect identified by the total number of line of code(or methods or classes) in the application or program.

----------------------------------------------------
Low priority-Low severity - A spelling mistake in a page not frequently navigated by users.or page taking time to refresh
Low priority-High severity- Application crashing in some very corner case.
High priority-Low severity - Slight change in logo color or spelling mistake in company name.
High priority-High severity - Issue with login functionality.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.25. What is a critical bug?
Ans. A critical bug is a bug that impacts a major functionality of the application and the application cannot be delivered without fixing the bug. It is different from blocker bug /  show stopper as it doesn't affect or blocks the testing of other part of the application.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.59. What is usability testing?

Alert pop = driver.switchTo().alert();
pop.accept(); // click on ok button.

pop.dismiss(); // click on cancel button.

driver.switchTo().window(handle);



Q: How would you simulate the right click operation in WebDriver?
Actions test = new Actions(driver);
test.contextClick().build().perform();

Selenium should be able to handle Android browser. There is a Selenium Android Driver for running tests in the Android browser.


Q:Compare Software Testing Vs. Debugging.
Testing - Done by Testing team , No need of design knowledge
Debugging - finding discripensy in code , perfomred by dev , need to have  full design knowledge


10. Highlight the role of QA in project development.

    Reduce the defects and errors
    Preventing defects from occurring
    Maintain the system quality as per the specifications
    Test the projects on failure parameters to check its fault tolerance


11. What are the tools of performance testing?
JMETER
LoadRunner(HP
QAload(Compuware):
Silk Performe
WebLoad(RadView)


8. What is Page Factory?
Page Factory gives an optimized way to implement Page Object Model. When we say it is optimized, it refers to the fact that the memory utilization is very good and also the implementation is done in an object oriented manner. 

The concept of separating the Page Object Repository and Test Methods is followed here also. Instead of having to use ‘FindElements’, we use annotations like: @FindBy ,@FindBy can accept tagName, partialLinkText, name, linkText, id, css, className & xpath as attributes.



12. How to scroll down a page using JavaScript in Selenium?
using javaScript-jsexecutor


15. What are different types of frameworks? 
Data Driven Framework:-
When the entire test data is generated from some external files like Excel, CSV, XML or some database table, then it is called Data Driven framework.

Keyword Driven Framework:-
When only the instructions and operations are written in a different file like an Excel worksheet, it is called Keyword Driven framework.

Hybrid Framework:-
A combination of both the Data Driven framework and the Keyword Driven framework is called Hybrid framework.


16. Which files can be used as data source for different frameworks?
Some of the file types of the dataset can be: excel, xml, text, csv, feature file etc.


20. How to set the size of browser window using Selenium?
driver.manage().window().setSize(d);


22. How to switch to a new window (new tab) which opens up after you click on a link?
String handle= driver.getWindowHandle();
for (String handle : driver.getWindowHandles()) 
{
driver.switchTo().window(handle);
}


23. How do you upload a file using Selenium WebDriver?
To upload a file we can simply use the command element.send_keys(file path). But there is a prerequisite before we upload the file. We have to use the html tag: ‘input’ and attribute type should be ‘file’.
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")


27. Which technique should you consider using throughout the script “if there is neither frame id nor frame name”?
If neither frame name nor frame id is available, then we can use frame by index.
Let’s say, that there are 3 frames in a web page and if none of them have frame name and frame id, then we can still select those frames by using frame (zero-based) index attribute. Each frame will have an index number. The first frame would be at index “0”, the second at index “1” and the third at index “2”. Once the frame has been selected, all subsequent calls on the WebDriver interface will be made to that frame.

driver.switchTo().frame(int arg0);


28. What is the significance of testng.xml?
I’m pretty sure you all know the importance of TestNG. Since Selenium does not support report generation and test case management, we use TestNG framework with Selenium. TestNG is much more advanced than JUnit, and it makes implementing annotations easy. That is the reason TestNG framewrok is used with Selenium WebDriver.

It is by taking instructions from the testng.xml file. We cannot define a test suite in testing source code, instead it is represented in an XML file, because suite is the feature of execution. The test suite, that I am talking about is basically a collection of test cases. 



30. Explain DataProviders in TestNG using an example. Can I call a single data provider method for multiple functions and classes?
@DataProvider marks a method as supplying data for a test method. The annotated method must return an Object[] where each Object[] can be assigned to parameter list of the test method.
To use the DataProvider feature in your tests, you have to declare a method annotated by @DataProvider and then use the said method in the test method using the ‘dataProvider‘ attribute in the Test annotation.
As far as the second part of the question is concerned, Yes, the same DataProvider can be used in multiple functions and classes by declaring DataProvider in separate class and then reusing it in multiple classes.



31. How to skip a method or a code block in TestNG?
@Test(enabled = false)


32. What is soft assertion in Selenium? How can you mark a test case as failed by using soft assertion?
Soft Assertions are customized error handlers provided by TestNG. Soft Assertions do not throw exceptions when assertion fails, and they simply continue to the next test step. They are commonly used when we want to perform multiple assertions.

To mark a test as failed with soft assertions, call assertAll() method at the end of the test.


1) What is Cucumber and what are the advantages of Cucumber?
To run functional tests written in a plain text Cucumber tool is used. It is written in a Ruby programming language.

Jbehave are based on stories while Cucumber is based on features


11) What is the language used for expressing scenario in feature file ?
Gherkin language is used to express scenario in feature files



13 What is constructor overloading?
Answer : Same as method overloading, Single class can have multiple constructors with same name as class name but all have different signatures (different input parameters and types) is called constructor overloading. 


14 : Can we override static methods?
 No.. We can not override static methods as they are part of  class not object.. You can override static methods but output will be different than the expected.



Q: Class loaders in java -- 3 type of classs loaders -Boot strap class loader , extension  class loader , system  class loader




15 : How to reverse string in java?
public static void main(String[] args) {
StringBuffer abc = new StringBuffer("I like java very much.");---------yaha aapkpo String na le kar Straing Buffer lena hai 
 System.out.println(abc.reverse());
}

String input = "Nipun Verma";
 
char charArray[] = input.tocharArray();

for(int i = charArray.length-1;i>=0;i--){
system.out.PrintLn(charArray[i]);



16 : Can we overload static methods? 
Ans:yes , both static as well as non static 



18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .



20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.


21 : Explain System.out.println();
--System : is a final class in  java.lang package.
--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.


 33 : Which is super class of all other classes in java?
Answer : java.lang.Object is  super class of all other classes in java.


36 : What is the difference between the Constructor and Method?
Constructor :

    Name of the constructor must be same as class name.
    Constructor must not have any return type.
    It is used to initialize the state of an object with new keyword
    It is not possible to call constructor directly. Constructors called implicitly when the new keyword 


Method :

    Method name can be any.
    Method must have return type.
    It is used to expose behavior of an object.
    Methods can be called directly.


40. What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?

    “this” keyword is used to store current object reference while “super” keyword is used to store super class object in sub class..
    “this” is used to access methods of the current class while “super” is used to access methods of the base class.
    this() used to call constructors in the same class whereas super() is used to call super class constructor, used to call cons of parent class like BadePapa called by papa and Papa called by Nipun.


 43 : Can we declare class as protected?
Answer : No, You can not declare class as protected.


48 : What is a package?
Answer : A package is a namespace which allows developer to organizes a group of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually it is just like folder which contains different types of files. It is easy to keep things organised by keeping related classes and interfaces into packages.


9 : What is string in java?
Answer : In Java programming, String is object which is prepared by sequence of characters.java.lang package has String class to create and manipulate strings. Read more on string in java.
characters always defined in quotes 


2. How can you use Selenium to identify an object?
You can use isElementPresent 
(String locator) to find an object using Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and if found, returns a Boolean. 


6) Explain what is assertion in Selenium and what are the types of assertion?
Assertion is used as a  verification point. It verifies that the state of the application conforms to what is expected.  The types of assertion are “assert” , “verify” and “waifFor”. 


11) What is the difference between verify and assert commands?
Assert:  Assert allows to check whether an element is on the page or not. The test will stop on the step failed, if the asserted element is not available. In other words, the test will terminated at the point where check fails.

Verify: Verify command will check whether the element is on the page, if it is not then the test will carry on executing.  In verification, all the commands are going to run guaranteed even if any of test fails. 


19) What is heightened privileges browsers?
The purpose of heightened privileges is similar to Proxy Injection, allows websites to do something that are not commonly permitted.  The key difference is that the browsers are launced in a special mode called heightened privileges.  By using these browser mode, Selenium core can open the AUT directly and also read/write its content without passing the whole AUT through the Selenium RC server. 


49)   Explain how you can use recovery scenario with Selenium?
Recovery scenarios depends upon the programming language you use.  If you are using Java then you can use exception handling to overcome same.  By using “Try Catch Block” within your Selenium WebDriver Java tests 


56)  Explain what are the limitations of Selenium IDE?
Exceptional handling is not present
Selenium IDE uses only HTML languages
External databases reading is not possible with IDE
Reading from the external files like .txt, .xls is not possible
Conditional or branching statements execution like if,else,  select statements is not possible


W0)  How you can convert any Selenium IDE tests from Selenese to another language?
You can use the format option of Selenium IDE to convert tests into another programming language


65)  In which format does source view shows your script in Selenium IDE ?
In Selenium IDE source view shows your script in XML format 



Q2. Explain public static void main(String args[]).
    public : Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.
    static : It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class based i.e it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.
    void : It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.
    main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.
    String args[] : It is the parameter passed to the main method.


Q3. Why Java is platform independent?
Platform independent practically means “write once run anywhere”. Java is called so because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.


Q4. Why java is not 100% Object-oriented?
Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive datatypes such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.


Q5. What are wrapper classes?
Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects)and vice versa .Autoboxing & Boxing


Q6. What are constructors in Java?
In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.
    --Default constructor
  --  Parameterized constructor


Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?
Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between String and string in C#.
Donno same hai no differnce , it is matter of your choice what to use , String or string .Mand devs use String ,however other use String .

Example ::
string str1= "Hello";
String str2 = "World!";
            
Console.WriteLine(str1.GetType().FullName); // System.String
Console.WriteLine(str2.GetType().FullName); // System.String

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?
Abstract :
=class can have abstract as well as normal methods , while Interface has only abstract methods .
=An abstract class can have non-abstract methods while All methods of an Interface are abstract.
=An abstract class can contain constructors while An Interface cannot contain constructors
==An abstract class can have instance variables. while An Interface cannot have instance variables
==An abstract class can have any visibility: public, private, protected. while An Interface visibility must be public (or) none

**An interface can extends another interface or interfaces (more than one interface) .
A class that implements interface must implements all the methods in interface.



Q:
Method Overriding:  
    In Method Overriding, sub class have the same method with same name and exactly the same number and type of parameters and same return type as a super class.
    Method Overriding is to “Change” existing behavior of method.
    It is a run time polymorphism.
    The methods must have same signature.
    It always requires inheritance in Method Overriding.


Method Overloading :polymorphism 
    In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.
    Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to method’s behavior.
    It is a compile time polymorphism.
    The methods must have different signature.
    It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.`


Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there. 



Q6. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
If a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.
Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred as Diamond Problem.

Robot API is used for handling Keyboard or mouse events. It is generally used to upload files to the server in selenium automation


78. What is a hybrid framework?
A hybrid framework is a combination of one or more frameworks. Normally it is associated with combination of data driven and keyword driven frameworks where both the test data and test actions are kept in external files(in the form of table).


79. What is selenium Grid?
Selenium grid is a tool that helps in distributed running of test scripts across different machines having different browsers, browser version, platforms etc in parallel. In selenium grid there is hub that is a central server managing all the distributed machines known as nodes.

80. What are some advantages of selenium grid?
The advantages of selenium grid are-
It allows running test cases in parallel thereby saving test execution time.
Multi browser testing is possible using selenium grid by running the test on machines having different browsers.
It is allows multi-platform testing by configuring nodes having different operating systems.


81. What is a hub in selenium grid?
A hub is server or a central point in selenium grid that controls the test executions on the different machines.


82. What is a node in selenium grid?
Nodes are the machines which are attached to the selenium grid hub and have selenium instances running the test scripts. Unlike hub there can be multiple nodes in selenium grid.



84 What is the purpose of creating a reference variable- ‘driver’ of type WebDriver instead of directly creating a FireFoxDriver object or any other driver’s reference in the statement Webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();?
By creating a reference variable of type WebDriver we can use the same variable to work with multiple browsers like ChromeDriver, IEDriver etc.



94. How can we set priority of test cases in TestNG?
Using priority parameter in @Test annotation in TestNG we can define priority of test cases. The default priority of test when not specified is integer value 0. Example-
@Test(priority=1)




1 : What is object in java?

1. What is the difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)? 
Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the process used to make Software Application. So the defects don’t arise when the Software Application is being developed. 
Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the defects in the Software Application



2. What is the difference between Preventative and Reactive approaches in testing? 
Preventive approach: It is also known as Verification Process. This approach is to prevent defects. In this approach, tests are designed at early stages of SDLC i.e., before the software has been produced. Here in this approach testers try to prevent defects in the early stages. It comes under Quality Analysis (QA). 
Reactive approach: It is also known as Validation Process. 
This approach is to identify defects. In this approach, tests are designed to execute after the software has been produced. Here we try to find defects. It comes under Quality Control (QC).



5. Explain the process of QA testing? 
In simple words, QA testing process is a step by step process which involves analyzing requirement documents, preparing test strategy, test plan and test cases, executing test cases when the build is ready. In the execution process QA’s perform different types of testing to make sure the software reaches or exceeds the expectation. 



6. What is the role of documentation in QA? 
Documentation plays a vital role in Quality Assurance. All the documents involved in SDLC such as Business Requirement Specifications, Designs, Inspection reports, Configurations, Code changes, Test Strategy, Test plans, Test cases, Bug reports, User manuals should be documented. 
• Documentation helps us to achieve high quality software product. 
• Documentation is necessary to make things more real 
• We could use documentation as a reference material and reuse it when necessary
• We could save lot of organization’s time, effort and money by maintaining proper documentation.
• Proper documentation makes easy for the client to review the software process.


10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include? 
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base



13. What is a Test case template? 
A test case template is a document comes under one of the test artifacts, which allows testers to develop the test cases for a particular test scenario in order to verify whether the features of an application are working as intended or not. Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario which has a set of pre-conditions, test data, expected result, post-conditions and actual results. Most of the companies are using test case management tools such as Quality Center (HP QC), JIRA etc.TDP and Rally, and some of the companies still using excel sheets to write test cases



14. What are the key components of a test case template .
The key components of a test case template are Project name, Module name, Created by, Date of creation, reviewed by, date of review, executed by, Date of execution, test scenario, tase case id, test case description, Precondition, Test steps, Test data, expected result, post condition, actual result, status of the bug. 



19. What is the difference between build and release? 
Build: A build is a version of a software. Every build has a number for identification purpose. Build is a pre-release version of a Release. Build is given to testing team by developers to test the application locally. Build numbers are incremental. 
Release: A release is the distribution of the final version of an application to the customer by software development team. 



20. What is bug leakage and bug release? 
Bug Leakage: A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that bug (which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage. 

Bug release: Releasing the software to the Production with some known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note. In other case, releasing the software to the testing team with some known bugs whose severity and priority is low. These bugs can be removed before releasing to production.



21. What is Bug triage? 
Bug triage is a formal process to find which bugs are important by prioritizing them based on their severity, frequency, risk and other important parameters. 
Testers assign priority (high, medium, low) to each and every bug in a bug triage meeting and based on the priority those bugs will be fixed in an order. By doing this we could save a lot of organization’s time. 


28. What is the difference between Compatibility testing and Cross browser testing? 
Compatibility testing: Testing an application on different hardware or software platform is Compatibility testing. Example: Different devices such as iPhone, Samsung etc., Different operating system such as Windows, Linux etc., 

Cross browser testing: Testing a web application on different browsers is Cross browser testing. Cross browser testing is a subset of Compatibility testing. Example: Google Chrome, IE 10, IE 11, Firefox 43 etc.,


5) Are you willing to cut corners to save time? 
The correct answer is NO. All test cases need to be run, and making assumptions frequently leads to issues down the road.


8) How do you go about learning a new product? 
This is perhaps the biggest challenge of being a QA engineer. They need to be comfortable and patient with learning complex software. They should be prepared to ask a lot of questions. 



Q1. In an application currently in production, one module of code is being modified. Is it necessary to retest the whole application or is it enough to just test functionality associated with that module?  
Vijay: Well, the answer is both. You will have to test the functionality of that module as well as the other modules. But you can differentiate on the stress to be given on the module to be tested. 


====================
85. What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63. What is Bucket Testing?
Bucket testing is a method to compare two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

84. What is Bug Release?
Releasing the software to the Production with the known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ques.88. What is mutation testing?
Ans. Mutation testing is a type of white box testing in which the source code of the application is mutated to cause some defect in its working. After that the test scripts are executed to check for their correctness by verifying the failures caused the mutant code.
============================================

Name some OOPS Concepts in Java?
Java is based on Object Oriented Programming Concepts, following are some of the OOPS concepts implemented in java programming.

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism-static/compile //dynamic/overriding
Inheritance
===========================================================================================================================================
What do you mean by platform independence of Java?
Platform independence means that you can run the same Java Program in any Operating System. For example, you can write java program in Windows and run it in Mac OS.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.
===========================================================================================================================================
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
java.lang.Object
===========================================================================================================================================
Why Java is not pure Object Oriented language?
Java is not said to be pure object-oriented because it supports primitive types such as int, byte, short, long etc. I believe it brings simplicity to the language while writing our code. Obviously, java could have wrapper objects for the primitive types but just for the representation, they would not have provided any benefit.
===========================================================================================================================================
**What is difference between path and classpath variables?
PATH is an environment variable used by the operating system to locate the executables.
Classpath is specific to java and used by java executables to locate class files.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is the importance of main method in Java?
main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. The syntax of main method is public static void main(String args[]).

===========================================================================================================================================
What is overloading and overriding in java?
overloading --Static /compile/
overriding --run/dymanci
===========================================================================================================================================
Can we overload main method?
Yes, we can have multiple methods with name “main” in a single class. However if we run the class, java runtime environment will look for main method with syntax as public static void main(String args[]).

===========================================================================================================================================
Can we have multiple public classes in a java source file?
We can’t have more than one public class in a single java source file. A single source file can have multiple classes that are not public.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
java.lang package is imported by default and we don’t need to import any class from this package explicitly.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is final keyword?
final keyword is used with Class to make sure no other class can extend it, for example String class is final and we can’t extend it.

We can use the final keyword with methods to make sure child classes can’t override it.

final keyword can be used with variables to make sure that it can be assigned only once.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is static keyword?
static keyword can be used with class level variables to make it global i.e all the objects will share the same variable.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
===========================================================================================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is multi-catch block in java?
multi-catch block where we can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block. This makes are code shorter and cleaner when every catch block has similar code.
 catch block handles multiple exceptions, you can separate them using a pipe (|) and in this case, exception parameter (ex)

Example :: 
try{
			rethrow("abc");
		}catch(FirstException | SecondException | ThirdException e){
			//below assignment will throw compile time exception since e is final
			//e = new Exception();
			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
		}
===========================================================================================================================================
What is static block?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader.It is used to initialize static variables of the class.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
--abstract keyword is used to create abstract class whereas interface is the keyword for interfaces.
--Abstract classes can have method implementations whereas interfaces can’t.
--A class can extend only one abstract class but it can implement multiple interfaces.
--We can run an abstract class if it has main() method whereas we can’t run an interface.

===========================================================================================================================================
What are Wrapper classes?
Java wrapper classes are the Object representation of eight primitive types in java. All the wrapper classes in java are immutable and final. Java 5 autoboxing and unboxing allows easy conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is Java Annotations?
Annotations is a metadata that are used to provide supplement information about a program.
Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler
===========================================================================================================================================
What does super keyword do?
Super keyword can be used to access super class method when you have overridden the method in the child class.
We can use super keyword to invoke superclass constructor in child class constructor but in this case, it should be the first statement in the constructor method.
Exmaple :
public ChildClass(String str){
		//access super class constructor with super keyword
		super();
		
		//access child class method
		test();
		
		//use super to access super class method
		super.test();
	}
===========================================================================================================================================
What is this keyword?
this keyword provides the reference to the current object and it’s mostly used to make sure that object variables are used, not the local variables having the same name.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is default constructor?
No argument constructor of a class is known as default constructor. When we don’t define any constructor for the class, java compiler automatically creates the default no-args constructor for the class. If there are other constructors defined, then compiler won’t create default constructor for us.

===========================================================================================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

JIT => BC ->Instructions
===========================================================================================================================================
What will be the output of following programs?
public class Test {

	public static String toString(){
		System.out.println("Test toString called");
		return "";
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println(toString());
	}
}

Answer: The code won’t compile because we can’t have an Object class method
===========================================================================================================================================
Is Selenium 2.0 different from Selenium 3.0? If so, how?
Selenium RC is called Selenium 2.0, and the integration of Selenium RC and WebDriver as a single tool has formed Selenium 3.0.
Sel 1 - IDE 
Sel 2 - RC 
Sel 3 - RC +WD

What is XPath?
While DOM is the recognized standard way for navigating through an HTML element tree, XPath is the navigation tool used to locate a web element based on its XML path.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is an object repository?
An object repository allows testers to accumulate web elements of the application under test (AUT), along with their locator values, in one or more centralized locations as restricted to hard-coding them within the test scripts.
===========================================================================================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
===========================================================================================================================================
15. What are data-driven framework and keyword-driven framework?
A data-driven framework in Selenium is an approach of separating a ‘dataset’ from the actual ‘test case’ (code). This framework is completely dependent on the input test data. The test data is inserted from the external sources, such as from an Excel file, a CSV file, or from any database. It also allows us to easily control how much data needs to be tested. We can easily increase the number of test parameters by adding more username and password fields to the Excel file (or other sources).

A keyword-driven framework is an extension to the data-driven testing framework in the sense that it not only isolates the test data from the scripts but also keeps the particular section of the code belonging to the test script in an external data file. These sets of code are known as keywords, and hence the framework is so named. Keywords are self-guiding and work based on what actions need to be performed on the application.

How will you use Selenium to upload a file?
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
element = driver.find_element_by_id("fileUpload")
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What is Java?
Answer: Java is an object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language originally designed by James Gosling and further developed by the Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. 
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you mean by Constructor?
Answer: A constructor is a method that has the same name as that of the class to which it belongs. As soon as a new object is created, a constructor corresponding to the class gets invoked. Although the user can explicitly create a constructor, it is created on its own as soon as a class is created. This is known as the default constructor. Constructors can be overloaded.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What are the features of Java?
Platform Independent 
High Speed Language - Uses JIT 
OOPS Concept Based 
Platform Independent 
==========================================================================================================================================
Question: How does Java enable high performance?
In the Just-in-Time compilation, the required code is executed at run time. Typically, it involves translating bytecode into machine code and then executing it directly. For enabling high performance, Java can make use of the Just-In-Time compilation. The JIT compiler is enabled by default in Java and gets activated as soon as a method is called.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you understand by Java IDEs?
Answer: A Java IDE is a software that allows Java developers to easily write as well as debug Java programs.Codenvy, Eclipse, and NetBeans are some of the most popular Java IDEs.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain Local variables and Instance variables in Java.
Even when not assigned, instance variables have a value that can be null, 0, 0.0, or false. This isn’t the case with local variables that need to be assigned a value, where failing to assign a value will yield an error
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What is an Object?
Answer: An instance of a Java class is known as an object. Two important properties of a Java object are behavior and state. An object is created as soon as the JVM comes across the new keyword.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain Method Overriding in Java?
Answer: Method Overriding in Java allows a subclass to offer a specific implementation of a method that has already provided by its parent, or super, class. Method overriding happens if the subclass method and the Superclass method have:

The same name
The same argument
The same return type
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you mean by Collections in Java? What are the constituents of Collections in Java?
Answer: A group of objects in Java is known as collections. collections can be considered as a framework designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following operations on objects:

Deletion
Insertion
Manipulation
Searching
Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

Classes – Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector
Interfaces – Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and Sorted Set
Maps – HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
Queues – Priority Queue
Sets – Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How is an Abstract class different from an Interface?
1.)While an interface has neither a constructor nor it can be instantiated, an abstract class can have a default constructor that is called whenever the concrete subclass is instantiated.
2.)Implementation of Methods – All classes that implement the interface need to provide an implementation for all the methods contained by it. A class that extends the abstract class, however, doesn’t require implementing all the methods contained in it. Only abstract methods need to be implemented in the concrete subclass.
3.)Type of Methods – Any abstract class has both abstract as well as non-abstract methods. Interface, on the other hand, has only a single abstract method.

===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Could you explain various types of Exceptions in Java? Also, tell us about the different ways of handling them.
Checked Exceptions – Classes that extend Throwable class, except Runtime exception and Error, are called checked exceptions. Such exceptions are checked by the compiler during the compile time. These types of exceptions must either have appropriate try/catch blocks or be declared using the throws keyword. ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception.

Unchecked Exceptions – Such exceptions aren’t checked by the compiler during the compile time. As such, the compiler doesn’t necessitate handling unchecked exceptions. Arithmetic Exception and ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception are unchecked exceptions.
Exceptions in Java are handled in two ways:

===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What role does the final keyword play in Java? What impact does it have on a variable, method, and class?
When a class is declared as final then it is disabled from being subclassed i.e. no class can extend the final class.
Any method accompanying the final keyword is restricted from being overridden by the subclass.
A variable followed by the final keyword is not able to change the value that it holds during the program execution. So, it behaves like a constant.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How do you make a thread in Java? Give examples.
Extend the Thread Class – The thread is available in the java.lang.Thread class. In order to make a thread, you need to extend a thread class and override the run method. For example,
public class Addition extends Thread {
public void run() {
}
}

Thread is used for Providing wait , when you want your script to wait for particular time .In that case we use Thread .
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Is it possible to write multiple catch blocks under a single try block?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to write several catch blocks under a single try block. However, the approach needs to be from specific to general. Following example demonstrates the same:

public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How does the throw keyword differ from the throws keyword?
1.)Throw used inside a function and Throws used in the signature of the function 
2.)Throw can throw one exception at a time , throws can handle multiple exception at a time seperated by comma 

Example 

void Demo() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException 
{ 
// Statements where exceptions might occur. 
throw new ArithmeticException(); 
}

Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
 #18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Below is the syntax of Cucumber Options tag:

@CucumberOptions(features="Features",glue={"StepDefinition"})

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #24) What is the name of the plugin that is used to integrate Eclipse with Cucumber?

===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

Continue and break -BreaK comes out of loop , while continue helps to come out of current iteration & jumps to loop.

Polymorphism-Static/Compile time/Overloading  //Dynamic/Runtime/overriding 

Singleton class  with example (DB connection) 
Abstraction 
Inheritance 
Encapsulation with example -Binding of code and method ,makes the variable private and methods public -to stop other classes usibg the variables directly .

Data Types (P and NP -String) 

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes
double and float variables  -8byte/4byte and precision (2 decimal and single decimal)


Final Keyword   -class/vari/method

base class in Java -Java.lang.object

Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

        System.out.println("Parent window handle: " + parentWinHandle);


//Dealing with Multiple Handlers 
Set<String> winHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
        // Loop through all handles
        for(String handle: winHandles){
            if(!handle.equals(parentWinHandle)){

Java Packages -contains classes and Interfaces

Finalise --Used with Garbage collector ,method called before GC to run clean up -means to close the resources asscoiated with objects like DB / netwrok connectn 
It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses. 
finalize() method in Java
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.

Abstarct class and Interface Diff ==========class extends/Implements interface ============does Interface extends/Implements Interface


Why multiple Inheritance not possible in java --Diamond Problem 
Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem



performance implications of Interfaces over abstract classes

Meaning of main method -Public static void main[String(arg())]=====main method of our class as private (No-as it will not allow to compile)


What is Exceptions - event interupting the progm from running, its  type (cmpile/Checked & runtime /unchecked )and handling (try-catch /try-finally)
Finally , how this can be skipped (using system.exit);used with try catch


how constructors can be invoked -creating a object using new keyword

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*
=====
way to skip Finally block of exception --user system.exit(); after try block of code

Can we override static methods of a class-No,because static method / variables has the right in their class only.
======
WHy Java is platform independent ?-yes , code written on any platform can run independently on any platform 
======
Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented? No , because java uses primitive data types (int,byte, - which are not objects -hence 100% Object-orientation not there
======
What are wrapper classes in Java? -Autoboxing /Unboxing concept ::Primitve Data types <--> Objects

Q7. What is singleton class in Java and how can we make a class singleton?--Make constructor private 
======
Q:Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
======
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

Q13. What is JIT compiler in Java?-It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions
======
Q:Q7. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Question 3: What is a Selenium webdriver?
Webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

Webdriver - Interface 
driver - Ref variable 
FirefoxDriver() - FirefoxDriver is an implementing class of WebDriver interface 

Having a reference variable of type WebDriver allows us to assign the driver object to different browser specific drivers. Thus allowing multi-browser testing by assigning the driver object to any of the desired browser.

===========================================================================================================================================
What are the three main versions of Selenium?

Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, and Selenium Webdriver.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is ‘selenese’?
Selenese is the language in which the scripts for Selenium IDE are written.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is an ‘element’?
Every single object that is present on the webpage is called an element
===========================================================================================================================================
What’s the difference between soft and hard asserts?
A soft assert will run the test and not throw an exception if the assert failed, while a hard assert will throw the exception immediately, and then continue with the testing process.

===========================================================================================================================================
 How would you retrieve certain element properties from CSS to Selenium?
You can retrieve element properties by using get().

===========================================================================================================================================
How would you scroll down the page using JavaScript?
To do so, you would have to execute the window.scrollBy() function.

===========================================================================================================================================
How would you take a screenshot with Selenium Webdriver?

// Take the screenshot using the Webdriver.
    File file= ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

// Now you can copy the screenshot somewhere on your system.
    FileUtils.copyFile(file, new File("c:\Selenium Testing Questions\screen.png"));

===========================================================================================================================================
How would you upload a file via Selenium Webdriver?
An example of how you could do it is provided below. Keep in mind that you have to include input and file tags.

===========================================================================================================================================

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

===========================================================================================================================================
Q15. Define a Java Class.
A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object. Let’s have a look at the syntax of a class.

1
2
3
class Abc {
member variables /

===========================================================================================================================================
Example of Break and Continue 

Example break:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if (i == 3)
{
break;
}
System.out.println(i);
}


Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}


===========================================================================================================================================
Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 

===========================================================================================================================================
Q7. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.


===========================================================================================================================================
Q10. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
MultipleInheritance - Java Interview Questions - EdurekaIf a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.

The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.

Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.

Q:What is difference between Web services testing and API Testing

Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
Webservoces used UDSL file provided by dev , API uses URI which again dev provides 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q: What Modifiers Can Be Used with A Local Inner Class

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

Q:What is Data Binding in Java ?
Ans :Data Binding
If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

public class GFG {
    
  //static instance of class globally accessible
  public static GFG instance = new GFG();

Q:Explain how hashmap works ?
Ans - HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. It implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value. HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class. It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields in HashMap.

It is the process of converting an object into an integer value. The integer value helps in indexing and faster searches.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Difference in Iterator and List<Iterator>?
Ans - Iterator :
1.Can move in forward direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
2.Cannot add or remove element

List<Iterator> :
1.Can move in forward and reverse  direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward and Reverse direction.
2.Can add or remove element

Q:Can constructor be Static ?
Ans -No
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Can constructor be final?
Ans -No

Q:Can constructor be private?
Ans -Yes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:what is Iterator in java?

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Make a collection
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");

    // Get the iterator
    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();

    // Print the first item
    System.out.println(it.next());
  }
}

Q:How To Set The Priority Of Cucumber Hooks?
Ans 
@Before(order = int): This runs in increment order, means value 0 would run first and 1 would be after 0
@After(order = int): This runs in decrements order, which means the opposite of @Before. Value 1 would run first and 0 would be after 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:--Suppose ther are 100 scamerios and using hooks i want to run it for 5 only .How this can be possible ?

import cucumber.api.java.After;
import cucumber.api.java.Before;
 
public class Hooks {
 
 @Before
    public void beforeScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run before the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @After
    public void afterScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run after the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @Before("@First")
    public void beforeFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the First Scenario");
    } 
 
 @Before("@Second")
    public void beforeSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the Second Scenario");
    } 
 
 
 @After("@First")
    public void afterFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the First Scenario");   
    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.


===Note ::
We can also indicate if we want before and after hooks to be executed with a specific tag only. Example − @Before(‘@Web’). The same concept of tag logical and/or can be applied with hooks as well. Example − @Before(@dev,@wip), @Before(@dev,~@wip)

Q:What is meant by test coverage?
Test coverage is a quality metric to represent the amount (in percentage) of testing completed for a product. It is relevant for both functional and non-functional testing activities. This metric is used to add missing test cases.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Explain what is Bug triage?

A bug triage is a process to

Ensure bug report completeness
Assign and analyze the bug
Assigning bug to proper bug owner
Adjust bug severity properly
Set appropriate bug priority
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.
------------------------------------------------API Questions------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Challanges faced in API testing ?
Ans : 1.Documentation - we need lot of documents like api , endpoints , URI , authentication keys , headers 
2.Access to DB - you hit a URI -> get response , how to validate response is as per expectation or not .specially jab api 3rd party ki ho , us case mein
we dnt have their server access .
3.Authentication --> dekhna padega kaise token milega , search karna padega 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:List out authentication techniques ?
Ans -Basic --usernanme and Password 
OAuth1 --Consumerkey , secretKey , --, --
OAuth2--token
Digest--usernanme and Password.But in encrypted form

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Why API is the best way to automate the things 
Ans -1.Lighter 
2.No need to update scripts as used to in case of UI , as xpath nahe hota koi
3.Early response 
4.Cost Effective 
5.Early stage par he user comes to know if the things working fine or not
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Rest API.
Ans - Set of functions/ API's where user sends a request and gets the response in return . Based on the response code we can come to knwo if the api is 
working fine or not .
It can act between 2 differnt platforms , mobile & web , 2 differnt languages 

Verfication to be done ::
1.Response code 
2.Response Time 
3.Header / Body 
4.Security - checking the authentication 
5.Errors if any

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:Q:Name the superclass in Java.
Java.lang. All different non-primitive are inherited directly or indirectly from this class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 
===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

Q:Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
==============================================================================================================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?

Q:What is stalelessness in rest API ?
Ans : Ideally in API , it should not keep a client state on server this restriction is called statelessness.
Staless means each request goes as a seperate trasaction , it doesnot retain the previous trasaction

Http is stateless transaction , it doesnot allows server to save the previous transaction
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is accept and content type in Http
Ans - Accept tells webservices what kind of response client is acceptins .jaise webservices is capable of sending xml/json format then accpt header as application/xml then xml response will be sent

 content type- tells what type/ format of data is sent in the request .if content type of data is application/xml then server will parse the data into xml.

Q:Q:Mention some key characteristics of REST?

Some key characteristics of REST includes

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===============================================================================================================================================

$.store.book[*].title------------display all the title  values jo book ke under hai , chahe us mein 5 objects ho ya kuch bhe 
$.store..title ------------------ here .. (recirsion patter)-- displays all the title in the json under store 


Suppose strore ke under book array hai , and book array mein 3 objects hain ,you want to display all the records of that book array do 

$.store.book[*]

if you want to display one first record of the book do 

$.store.book[1]

agar pehle 2 records display karne ho to book array mein se .........>>>>>

$.store.book[0,1]-----------------------> vvvvimp ----> yeh pehle 2 he records display karega 


if you want to have category out of above two books , do it as 
$.store.book[0,1].category



if i want to display all the books data , do like
$..book


if you want to display in thw range say 1,2 ,3,4,5 record karna hai out of 10 record use :
$.store.book[0:4] 
Note : hoghes range yaha 4 ayegi as aapko 5 records tak chaiye

Q:Diff between URL and URI ?

URL -URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is often defined as a string of characters that is directed to an address. It is a very commonly used way to locate resources on the web. URL is a type of URI.

URI -URI is the superset of URL.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Hybrid Framework?
Hybrid Driven Framework is a mix of both the Data-Driven and Keyword Driven frameworks.

In this case, the keywords as well as the test data, are externalized. Keywords are stored in a separate Java class file and test data can be maintained in a Properties file or an Excel file.

===============================================================================================================================================

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?
WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

Q:Api vs WebServices 

Ans : 
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Trobleshooting in API?

Ans 
Is the URL correct?
Is the API key valid? - Each user has a unique key.
Is the authorization header valid?
Are the request parameters valid?
Did the API call return the expected results?
Did the API call return the expected results with expected performance 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Auth vs autherization 

Ans 
Authentication is when an entity proves an identity. In other words, Authentication proves that you are who you say you are. This is like having a driver license which is given by a trusted authority that the requester, such as a police officer, can use as evidence that suggests you are in fact who you say you are.

Authorization is an entirely different concept and in simple terms, Authorization is when an entity proves a right to access. In other words, Authorization proves you have the right to make a request. Consider the following - You have a working key card that allows you to open only some doors in the work area, but not all of them.


In summary:
Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity
Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to check security in API's 

Ans: 
4 Quick Ways to Test if Your API is Secure

    1. Parameter tampering
    2. Injection
    3. Input Fuzzing
    4. Unhandled HTTP Methods
	
1. Parameter tampering

Parameter tampering is when an attacker changes the values in an API request. This type of attack takes advantage of hidden parameters used in API requests to pass “secure” information. For example, this could be used to change the purchase price of a product by changing the value assigned to the price or cost parameter. 
To test if parameter tampering is possible, you can examine any API related elements in your site or web app through the development console in your browser. If you change the value in your console, submit it with the included change, and the application accepts it, your API is not secure. 


2. Injection

An injection attack occurs when an attacker inserts hostile input into an API. A common example is SQL injection, where SQL queries or commands are submitted, in the hope that they will be run against the backend database.

Another common example is command injection, where an attacker inserts commands into a request or input. When processed, these commands are read by the receiving system as separate from the request, and are executed as standalone commands. 

Attackers can use these attacks for many malicious purposes, including gaining access to systems through privilege escalation, rebooting devices, or deleting data.

To test if your API is vulnerable to command injection, you can try submitting a request like the following:


3. Input Fuzzing

Input fuzzing is performed by providing random information to an API through automation until an unexpected effect occurs. Often, the application will crash. Other effects might include an error message indicating that an input was partially valid. 
When performing fuzz tests, the two most common inputs to target are numbers and strings. To test number inputs, you should try submitting numbers outside the expected range, such as negative numbers, very large numbers, or decimal numbers. To test strings you can send very large strings, or strings with unexpected unicode.

Fuzzing reveals an application’s vulnerability to being remotely crashed by an attacker. It is unlikely to reveal significant weaknesses that an attacker could exploit, but is stlil useful in testing the robustness of an application



4.Unhandled HTTP Methods
To test if unsecure or unintended methods are allowed, try sending requests with known but unused and arbitrary methods. If either gets a valid response rather than an error (such as 405 or 501) you need to block those methods.

Q:What is rest assured ?
Ans - It is java lib that helps to automate the rest api's .

It can be used for writing test cases and can be integrated with maven and extent reports .Also response can be verified using this , it is compactable with diff http verbs such as put,post,delete,patch and Get.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the static imports needed for rest assured automation 
Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why static imports , why we need and what will happen agar yeh na ho to

Ans : Static import karne se (jo hum imports mein static keyword use karte hain ) , uska advantage yeh hota ki aapk kisi bhe package se koi bhe method kisi aur pacjage mein bula sakte ho without even importing the package .

simply aise kar, jaise package 1 mein 2 methods hain method1 , method2 

aap ko yeh package 2 mein bulana hai to using static in the import ypou can directly do 

method1();
methpd2();

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to get the response time from response ?
Ans 
Res.gettime();
Res.gettimeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);
Res.time();
Res.timeIn(TimeUnit.Seconds);

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Form Authentication ?

Ans :
Using Form Authentication
Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.

When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information.

Normally, the form indicates the endpoint that it'll call with its action attribute, and each input field corresponds with a form parameter sent in the request.

If the login form is simple enough and follows these rules, then we can rely on REST Assured to figure out these values for us:

given().auth()
  .form("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
  
  
Example : 
baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/api";
given()
        .auth().form("admin", "admin", new FormAuthConfig("/authentication/", "j_username", "j_password"))
.when()
        .get("/formAuth")
        .then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200);  

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to handle stale element exception ?

Ans - keeping the code which is causign stale element exception in try block and in catch block identify same element & copy same code jo issue kar 
rha tha un catch block 

see example - bmwCheckBox was causing staleekenebt exception

	
public void StaleElementHandled() throws InterruptedException {
		
		WebElement bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
		bmwCheckBox.click();
		driver.navigate().refresh();
		
		//Jo bhe statement is causing stale element out that in try block . In Catch block -followed by identifying same 
		//element once again and again keeping same line in catch block
		
		
		try {
			
		    bmwCheckBox.click();
		
		}
		
		catch(Exception e) {
			bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
			bmwCheckBox.click();
			System.out.println("Exception handled is " +  e.getMessage());
		}

Q:8 Where to use hashmap & where hash table?

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.
HashMap- not synchronished , HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values ,HashMap is fast. HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.
HashTables - sychronised , slow , Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value. , Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
===============================================================================
Q:What is JSON ?

Ans : Understanding mein issue aye to refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfshV5n6ac
Java Script object notation - it takes the input in form of key:value pair and it starts with { or [ .{ for jsonObject and [ for jsonArray

JSON Schema : it is a schema / structural validation .Jo bhe response aa rha hai aapko , json schema is validating the expected data type and format .
jaise firstname , lastname a rha hai response mein to unki datatype string honi chaiye ---- to es case mein schema validator yhi confirm karega ki 
fields : firstname , lastname  have datatype string or not 


Steps :
1.Login to https://www.jsonschema.net/home
2.Paste your response here 
3.It will share the scheme with you 
4.Go to postman 
5.Under test tab 
6.Select tiny validator jaise aap status code ke liye karte ho 

Now paste this 



var schema = {
====== Paste ypur schema :: jo aapko yaha se mila hai  https://www.jsonschema.net/home  =============
}


var actualData = pm.response.json(); /////////////////yeh as such copy kar dena line .yeh actual response leke ayega 



pm.test('Schema is valid', function () {
    pm.expect(tv4.validate(actualData, schema)).to.be.true;
    
});

Note : In above we are validating jo hamare response mein datatype aa rhe hain har field ke against wohi aa rha hai kya nahe 
Postman mein you can validate using tiny validator (under test tab).

		WebElement signIn = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='nav-link-accountList']"));
		signIn.click();
		
		WebElement emailTxtBox = driver.findElement(By.id("ap_email"));
		String color_Before_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;  
		jsExecutor.executeScript("arguments[0].style.background='green'", emailTxtBox);  
		
		String color_After_Highlight = emailTxtBox.getCssValue("background-color");
		
		//Verfuing actually colour has changed or not 
		
		if(color_Before_Highlight.equals(color_After_Highlight)) {
			driver.quit();
		}
		else 
		{
			System.out.println("Text Box Highlighted");

Ans - import static io.restAssured.restAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.*;---------->Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read
import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.asPrettyString());
		
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Status Code is : + ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.statusCode());
		
		System.out.println("**********Headers are :: ***************");
		System.out.println(Res.headers());
		
		Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));
		
		return Res;

the SOAP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between request.get(“https//dev-mode.com/api/allcustomers”) and request.request(Method.GET,”/ allcustomers “);

Ans : requests.post(…) is just a wrapper around requests.request('POST', …). As long as you're using standards methods, the former helps readability and reduces the risk of easily avoidable mistakes, while writing the verb.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:And & But keyword in cucumber ?
Ans : 
And: This is used for statements that are an addition to the previous Steps and represent positives statements.

But: This is used for statements that are an addition to previous Steps and represent negative statements.

    Given user is on Application landing page
    And Sign in button is present on screen
    When user clicks on Sign in button
    Then user is displayed login screen
    When user enters "ShankarGarg" in username field
    And user enters "123456" in password field
    And user clicks Sign in button
    Then user is on home page
    And title of home page is "GitHub"
    But Sign in button is not present

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is ItestListners ?
Ans :  ITestListener is the most adopted TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver. Providing you with an easy to implement interface through a normal Java class, where the class overrides every method declared inside the ITestListener

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Listeners in TestNG?
Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. As the name suggests Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are many types of TestNG listeners available.

AnnotationTransformer ,
IAnnotationTransformer2 ,
IConfigurable ,
IConfigurationListener ,
IExecutionListener,
IHookable ,
IInvokedMethodListener ,
IInvokedMethodListener2 ,
IMethodInterceptor ,
IReporter,
ISuiteListener,
ITestListener .

ITestListener has following methods

OnStart- OnStart method is called when any Test starts.
onTestSuccess- onTestSuccess method is called on the success of any Test.
onTestFailure- onTestFailure method is called on the failure of any Test.
onTestSkipped- onTestSkipped method is called on skipped of any Test.
onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage- method is called each time Test fails but is

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What isis diff between onstart method and beforetest ?
Ans 
OnStart will run at the statof the test method havign annonation as @test at the top.

Beforetest will run for he mthods having annonations @test 

Before test wil run first and then on start will run 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation.

Q:How can we move to element from source to desitinaion in seleniu without using action class ?

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?

Q:Breaking changes in API 

Ans -What Is a Breaking Change?

As the name might suggest, a breaking change to an API is any change that can break a client’s application. Usually, breaking changes involve modifying or deleting existing parts of an API.

With the latter, deletion, it’s inevitable that applications break. If a client is consuming the deleted resource, field, or structure, parts of their application will cease to function. The extent to which this really “breaks” the application can vary greatly, from having a minor cosmetic effect to making the application entirely unusable; regardless, deletion is still considered a breaking change.

Modification is less likely to break applications. Even if a client is using the resource, field, or endpoint that is modified, there’s a chance their application will continue to work as normal, depending on the implementation. For example, if a multimedia API goes from returning JPEGs to PNGs, applications that save those file types as well will most likely continue to work.

Of course, modification still carries a genuine risk of breaking client applications. Since the responsible API owner doesn’t leave these things to chance, modifications should also be treated as breaking changes.
Examples

Common examples of breaking changes include:

    Deleting a resource or method
    Deleting a response field
    Modifying a resource or method URI
    Modifying a field name
    Modifying required query parameters
    Modifying authorization
    Modifying rate-limiting
	
	
Best Practices for Breaking Changes
====================================
If you want to take the best possible care of your clients (and you should!), there are quite a few best practices you can adopt to avoid and mitigate breaking changes. Let’s start with how you can avoid them, since this is always preferable for developers:

    Test your code for accidental breaking changes. Breaking changes are particularly troublesome if you don’t know they’re there. Thankfully, there’s an easy solution for API owners that build against an OpenAPI specification: openapi-diff. This open-source tool compares two OpenAPI (v3) specifications and alerts you if any (obvious) breaking changes have been made.
    Future-proof your documentation. It might be cliché, but documentation really can help you avoid breaking changes — especially additive ones. For example, in the early stages of a platform, some objects may consist of just a few fields. If you know considerably more fields will be added in the future, you can instruct clients to expect this and build their applications against it.
    Carefully plan your API in advance. Once again, it might be obvious, but the importance of carefully planning your APIs cannot be understated. Even something as mundane as naming can result in breaking changes — or a persistently bad developer experience — if poorly planned.

Q:What Are Web Services?

Answer: A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet like inter-process communication on a single computer.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Messaging In Restful Web Services?

Answer: A client sends a message in the form of an HTTP Request and the server responds in the form of an HTTP Response. This technique is termed Messaging. These messages contain message data and metadata i.e. information about the message itself.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Request?
Answer: An HTTP Request has five major parts :

    Verb − Indicate HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc.
    URI − Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify the resource on the server.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Request Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Request message as key-value pairs. For example, client ( or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of the message body, cache settings, etc.
    Request Body − Message content or Resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Core Components Of A HTTP Response?
Answer: An HTTP Response has four major parts:-

    Status/Response Code − Indicate Server status for the requested resource. For example, 404 means resource not found and 200 means response is ok.
    HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
    Response Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Response message as key-value pairs. For example, content length, content type, response date, server type, etc.
    Response Body − Response message content or Resource representation.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Advantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following are the benefits of statelessness in RESTful web services:

    Web services can treat each method request independently.
    Web services need not maintain the client’s previous interactions. It simplifies application design.
    As HTTP is itself a statelessness protocol, RESTful Web services work seamlessly with HTTP protocol.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Are The Disadvantages Of Statelessness In Restful Web Services?

Answer: Following is the disadvantage of statelessness in RESTful web services:-

Web services need to get extra information in each request and then interpret to get the client’s state in case client interactions are to be taken care of.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Do You Mean By Idempotent Operation?
Answer: Idempotent operations mean their result will always the same no matter how many times these operations are invoked.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Idempotent?
Answer: PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Type Of Web Services Methods Are To Be Read-Only?

Answer: GET operations are read-only and are safe.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Caching?

Answer: Caching refers to storing server responses in the client itself so that a client needs not to make a server request for the same resource again and again. A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Created?
Answer: The date header provides the date and time of the resource when it was created.

Q:Which Header Of HTTP Response, Provides The Date And Time Of The Resource When It Was Last Modified?
Answer: Last Modified header provides the date and time of the resource when it was last modified.


Q:Which Header Of Http Response Provides Control Over Caching?
Answer: Cache-Control is the primary header to control caching.

Q:Which Header Of Http Response Sets Expiration Date And Time Of Caching?
Answer: Expires header sets expiration date and time of caching.

Q:Why string is immutable 
Q: Why multiple inhertance not possibe in java 
Q: Polynorphism


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

Q:Example of method overridiing in selenium 

Ans : WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?

Ans -Usage of Interfaces and Abstract classes is needed for better architectural design for better scalability, maintainability and less painful to make a bigger change.

Example : 
There is an entrepreneur who wants to start a “Construction service provider” company and wants to onboard three builders discussed above. All three builders were ready to be part of the entrepreneur ‘s company but they kept below conditions:

We will not share our techniques or style of getting work done with you. You just need to give the tasks to do and do not care how we will do that.


More or less same story with Selenium WebDriver as well. The purpose of Selenium WebDriver to automate browsers but they do not know how each browser works internally.

Every browser has their own logic to perform browser’s actions such as Launching a browser, closing a browser, loading URL, handling different type of web elements. Same operations are performed in different ways by different browsers.

Without knowing internal working mechanisms of browsers, Selenium WebDriver developers can not write codes to perform actions. If they get to know the internal mechanism some how, it will be difficult to manage when internal mechanism changes and this should not break flow for other browsers.

So to make it simple, a contract is placed between Selenium WebDriver developers and browsers and that contract is in form of WebDriver. A WebDriver consist of all related basic methods which could be performed on a browser.


WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

====================================================================
Q:why we pass string as argument in main method ?
Because by passing String arrays, we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily. There can be several parameters!
Also, all the other datatypes can be easily converted from String!
Because if also we are not passing any argument value while running the main method then also its working fine. It creates an empty string, when we are not passing any values to string arg[]. Where else in case of other data type we have to pass some values.

Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?

Ans :The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?

Ans : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.

Q:What is difference b/w String s=new String(),String s=””;

Ans : In Java String s=new String() will create a new String object and assign the reference to the variable s
But String s="xyz"
create new String object in the Stack with the value "xyz" assign to the variable s
the second method if we are trying to create new String sample="xyz"
the reference value which is previously created for s is used


String str1= “Strings are immutable”;

In this object of String is created.Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the string constant pool first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool.

2. String str2= new String(“Strings are immutable”);

As we saw above that when we tried to assign the same string object to two different literals, compiler only created one object and made both of the literals to point the same object. To overcome that approach we can create strings like this:

String str1 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
String str2 = new String("Strings are immutable"); 
In this case compiler would create two different object in memory having the same string.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Differenve between hashset and Linked hashset ?
Ans : 

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet.
HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,

Q:what is Dictionary in java?
Ans : 
A java dictionary is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key, its corresponding value can be stored and retrieved as needed; thus, a dictionary is a list of key-value pairs.

The first step to creating a dictionary in Java is to choose a class that implements a “key-value pair” interface; a few examples include HashTables, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Example :

Q:Agile requirements 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM_m6EzMg3k


Ans : EPIC ------->Feature -------> User Story -------> Task

Scrum Roles -------> Product owner  -------> Scrum master -------> Scurm Team 


1.Product Owner -  Understanding req of customer , he notes what customer wants & he understand what is the req . Documents what customer wants in form of epic , maintains product backlog ( tracks what status the software is ) , team members will pick itmes from product backlog , Product owner also manabegs the release 

Product Backlog - In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.


2.Scrum master - He is intermediater between product owner and team , He checks if the scrum is correctly forllowed , he also makes sure team breaks down feature into story , he manages the things between  team , helps to resolve the roadblock if any .


3.Scrum Team - works on delivery , ike dev team , QA team . if they have any issue they can contact scrum owner 




Sprint Activities ::
--------------------------
Userstories broken into small stories and stroies to be delivered into small time .This is called Sprint .

Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done

Explanation 
1.Story - jo kaam aaya hai jaise add payment method as payonline / add some button on UI / ya kuch bhe 
2.To Do - Jo kaam shuru karna hai say you picked user story - Add button to UI 
3.In progress - Yaha woh kaam ayega aap kar rhe ho presently 
4.Testing - Jis feature ki teating kar rhe ho
5.Done - Jo develop aur test donno ho chuke hain

Q:Why Jira 

Ans - Bug management , Agile process management , Project management tool, helps tp create backlogs , create sprints , create tasks , create bugs , manage multiple release , can be integrated with CI tools , helps to update tasks , code integrate , manage tasks on the board
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Product Backlog ?
Ans : 
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  


In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.

Q:What is difference between sel 3 &4

Ans : The architecture for Selenium 3 includes the JSON Wire Protocol. However, Selenium 4 does not include the JSON Wire Protocol, and that’s the contrast between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON Protocol is used to transfer information between Selenium client (webDriver) and Browser driver 


Sekenium 4 ::
Selenium 4 has direct communication between the client and server. The client still has 2 parts (Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings) while Browser Drivers are the server.

Selenium Client sends out a request to perform a command.
The WebDriver Language Bindings is a code library designed to drive actions.
Browser Drivers receive the request and then return a response after an automation Test Script executes on the Web Browser:


Selenium4 is more stable then selenium 3.

Q:Q:What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

Q:What is Agile Methodology?
• In the Agile methodology, each project is broken up into several ‘Iterations’.
• AGILE is a methodology that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing 
throughout the software development life cycle of the project. Both development and testing 
activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model.
• All Iterations should be of the same time duration (between 2 to 8 weeks).
• At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered.
• Any remaining features that cannot be delivered in the first iteration will be taken up in the 
next iteration or subsequent iterations, based on priority.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Difference between defect, error, bug, failure and fault?

A mistake in coding is called error. 
Error found by tester is called defect.
Defect accepted by development team then it is called bug.
Build does not meet the requirements then it is failure.

Q:What is white box testing and list the types of white box testing?

White box testing technique involves selection of test cases based on an analysis of the internal 
structure (Code coverage, branches coverage, paths coverage, condition coverage etc.) Of a 
component or system. It is also known as Code-Based testing or Structural testing. Different types of 
white box testing are:
• Statement Coverage.
• Decision Coverage.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Mention what are the different types of test coverage techniques?

Different types of test coverage techniques include :-
Statement Coverage: It verifies that each line of source code has been executed and tested.
Decision Coverage: It ensures that every decision in the source code is executed and tested.
Path Coverage: It ensures that every possible route through a given part of code is executed and 
tested

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is casting ?

Ans : Converting one data type to another . 
Types 

1.)) Implicit ---- Widening ----------> Converts smaller data type to bigger , happens automatically [equals ke left side bada hoga]
2.)) Explicit casting -----Narrowing ----------> Converts bigger data type to smaller , manually programmer has to do it [equals ke left sise jab chota ho aur right se bada ho , tab explicit use hoga]


Implicit example :: int -> byte , int -> float , float -> decimal


Explicit example :: byte -> int , decimal-> float 


few examples 
1.) double dd = 4; // implicit (automatically casting ho jaeygi , kyn ki left mein bada hai) 
2.) int ii = 4.75;  // this will give error 

it should be int i = (int)4.75;

3.)float f = 4; // implicit casting 

4.)float f = 4.75; // this will give error 

it should be float f = (float) 4.55;

5.) double  f = 4.55; //implicit casting

Q:Can you explain RequestSpecification request = RestAssured.given();

Ans -RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like. This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
Also , it will hep us to modify the request like adding header , chnaging some parameter 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What you will validate in headers of the api ?

Ans : we can verify the count , content , content-type etc . Since this header will be in form of key -Value pair 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between request.get(“https//dev-mode.com/api/allcustomers”) and request.request(Method.GET,”/ allcustomers “);

Ans : requests.post(…) is just a wrapper around requests.request('POST', …). As long as you're using standards methods, the former helps readability and reduces the risk of easily avoidable mistakes, while writing the verb.

Q:Which is more faster and efficient string builder or string buffer 

Ans : String builder as this is non synchronization 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why we need collection , whay collections are there 

Ans : Before collections we use to use array , which has a limitation that whatever size is defined at the time of decalaring a array , it cannot be increased later on .Agar size 5 diya hai to aur 6 element add kar diye then you will get error - arrayoutofbound .

To overcome this concern we have collections like arraylist , linkedlist 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Basic methods present in collection interface 

Ans : add , remove , addall , removeall , retainall , size(), clear(), isempty()

All the interfaces like set , queue , list which extends interface(collection) will have all the metnhods which collection interface has 
===============================================================================================================================================

Say if you are test simple UI .you can take 1-2 story points , however when end to end flow needs to be checked then you may consume 405 story points 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why static imports , why we need and what will happen agar yeh na ho to

Ans : Static import karne se (jo hum imports mein static keyword use karte hain ) , uska advantage yeh hota ki aapk kisi bhe package se koi bhe method kisi aur pacjage mein bula sakte ho without even importing the package .

simply aise kar, jaise package 1 mein 2 methods hain method1 , method2 

aap ko yeh package 2 mein bulana hai to using static in the import ypou can directly do 

method1();
methpd2();

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Form Authentication ?

Ans :
Using Form Authentication
Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.

When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information.

Normally, the form indicates the endpoint that it'll call with its action attribute, and each input field corresponds with a form parameter sent in the request.

If the login form is simple enough and follows these rules, then we can rely on REST Assured to figure out these values for us:

given().auth()
  .form("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
  
  
Example : 
baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/api";
given()
        .auth().form("admin", "admin", new FormAuthConfig("/authentication/", "j_username", "j_password"))
.when()
        .get("/formAuth")
        .then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200);

public void StaleElementHandled() throws InterruptedException {
		
		WebElement bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));
		bmwCheckBox.click();
		driver.navigate().refresh();
		
		//Jo bhe statement is causing stale element out that in try block . In Catch block -followed by identifying same 
		//element once again and again keeping same line in catch block
		
		
		try {
			
		    bmwCheckBox.click();
		
		}
		
		catch(Exception e) {
			bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));

Q:Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

Q:: Schema Validation in rest Assured ?
Ans :

First of all , dependency add karo json-schema validation ki 

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator.*;---------------------Schema Validatons

1.Response ko aap schema mein change karo
2.Keep it somewhere in the framework 
3.Step 2 ko read karo jaise aap json file read karte ho , yaad rhe this starts with object to JSONObject ayega last step mein 
4.Now under http method say post/get keep this line 
5.	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));


Example :

public Response postRequest(String bodyData , String URI_Key , String ExpectedScheme) {
		Response Res = given().contentType(ContentType.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(PRP.getProperty(URI_Key));
		
		System.out.println("***********Post Request Response is : + ***************");

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

		  driver.get("https://www.cacert.com/");
		 
		  //Without using desired capability this site will ask you to accept certifications 
		  //Doing with automation canot be done without help of Desired Cap 
	
	}
		
	public void Case_With_DesiredCapability() {
		
		String driverPath = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe";
		  System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", driverPath);
		  
		DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
		caps.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true); // This will accept the certificates 
		
		  driver=new ChromeDriver(caps); 
		  System.out.println("Chrome driver used"); 
		  
		  driver.get("https://www.cacert.com/");
		  
		  //When Desired capabilty is used , your driver will automatically under what to handle 
		  //In above lines it will accept any insecure certification message 
		  //Desired cap is a class by selenium - whihc has inbuild functions/methods to handle such scanerios 
		  //Browsers like chrome/firefox /IE all have such capabalities like this 
		 
	}

Q:4. Difference between serialization and deserialization

when ever you create a class , you create a object for that .Once you execute/run the object gets destroyed by itself .But if you want to reruse the class then you use the concept of serialization and deserialization.

Serialization : converts  object to bytes and store them in some DB 
Deserialization : converts  Bytes  to Object  
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What Is Caching?

Answer: Caching refers to storing server responses in the client itself so that a client needs not to make a server request for the same resource again and again. A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:*******Q:Explain the statements and also tell what is the differnce between both 

double a = 100 ;
double a = (double) 100;

Ans :: In first case , we are assigning value to variable a as 100 and data type of a is double .So the value will be like 100.00 and size will be of 8 byte 

In second case , we are type casting the value .Basically 100 jo hai woh int value hai usko double mein convert karne ke liye we re doing this .Int ka size 4 byte hota hai after casting it to double it will be chnage to 8 byte 

*****Implicit and explicit / up & downcasting  yaha woh use ho rha hai .
Int -----> double (Up casting)
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Q:Clone() method ?

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

Q:*******Use of import static org.hamcrest?

Ans : Hamcrest is a widely used framework for unit testing in the Java world.

Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read. For this, it provides additional matcher classes which can be used in test for example written with JUnit. You can also define custom matcher implementations.

To use Hamcrest matchers in your test you use the assertThat statement followed by one or several matchers.

Whenever we want to assert something we use hancrest , for example 
	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));

Q:Use of constructor ?

Ans : he purpose of constructor is to initialize the object of a class while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code. Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and synchronised while methods can be.


Constructor as the name suggest are useful for creating objects.  Constructor is not a method because it does not have any return type. Not void also. In fact the main difference between constructor and a method is that constructor does not have return type while methods must have return types.
In any object oriented programming language you can not create an instance of class without constructor. So they are provided by default by the compiler if you are not providing one.

2.)) Explicit casting -----Narrowing ----------> Converts bigger data type to smaller , manually programmer has to do it [equals ke left sise jab chota ho aur right se bada ho , tab explicit use hoga]


Implicit example :: int -> byte , int -> float , float -> decimal


Explicit example :: byte -> int , decimal-> float 


few examples 
1.) double dd = 4; // implicit (automatically casting ho jaeygi , kyn ki left mein bada hai) 
2.) int ii = 4.75;  // this will give error 

it should be int i = (int)4.75;

3.)float f = 4; // implicit casting 

4.)float f = 4.75; // this will give error 

it should be float f = (float) 4.55;

5.) double  f = 4.55; //implicit casting

Q:Can you explain RequestSpecification request = RestAssured.given();

Ans -RequestSpecification is an interface that allows you to specify how the request will look like. This interface has readymade methods to define base URL, base path, headers, etc. We need to use given() method of RestAssured class to get a reference for RequestSpecification. 
Also , it will hep us to modify the request like adding header , chnaging some parameter 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What you will validate in headers of the api ?

Ans : we can verify the count , content , content-type etc . Since this header will be in form of key -Value pair 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between request.get(“https//dev-mode.com/api/allcustomers”) and request.request(Method.GET,”/ allcustomers “);

Ans : requests.post(…) is just a wrapper around requests.request('POST', …). As long as you're using standards methods, the former helps readability and reduces the risk of easily avoidable mistakes, while writing the verb.

Q:Why we need collection , whay collections are there 

Ans : Before collections we use to use array , which has a limitation that whatever size is defined at the time of decalaring a array , it cannot be increased later on .Agar size 5 diya hai to aur 6 element add kar diye then you will get error - arrayoutofbound .

To overcome this concern we have collections like arraylist , linkedlist 

===============================================================================================================================================

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why static imports , why we need and what will happen agar yeh na ho to

Ans : Static import karne se (jo hum imports mein static keyword use karte hain ) , uska advantage yeh hota ki aapk kisi bhe package se koi bhe method kisi aur pacjage mein bula sakte ho without even importing the package .

simply aise kar, jaise package 1 mein 2 methods hain method1 , method2 

aap ko yeh package 2 mein bulana hai to using static in the import ypou can directly do 

method1();
methpd2();

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Form Authentication ?

Ans :
Using Form Authentication
Many services provide an HTML form for the user to authenticate by filling in the fields with their credentials.

When the user submits the form, the browser executes a POST request with the information.

Normally, the form indicates the endpoint that it'll call with its action attribute, and each input field corresponds with a form parameter sent in the request.

If the login form is simple enough and follows these rules, then we can rely on REST Assured to figure out these values for us:

given().auth()
  .form("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
  
  
Example : 
baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/api";
given()
        .auth().form("admin", "admin", new FormAuthConfig("/authentication/", "j_username", "j_password"))
.when()
        .get("/formAuth")
        .then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200);

		//element once again and again keeping same line in catch block
		
		
		try {
			
		    bmwCheckBox.click();
		
		}
		
		catch(Exception e) {
			bmwCheckBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//legend[contains(text(),'Checkbox')]/following::input[@id='bmwcheck']"));

Q:What is the difference between SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces in Selenium or what is the relationship between them?

Ans :WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	 SearchContext driver = new FirefoxDriver()

Interface SearchContext
SearchContext Interface have 2(two) subinterfaces:

WebDriver
WebElement'


---
The implementing classes are:

ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
EventFiringWebDriver
FirefoxDriver
InternetExplorerDriver
OperaDriver
RemoteWebDriver
RemoteWebElement
SafariDriver


SearchContext has only two methods:

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)




Explanation 1 - 
================
SearchContext is the superInterface of Webdriver and WebElement interfaces. As said in previous answers, searchContext have only two abstract methods.

findElement(By by)
findElements(By by)
If we create object using searchContext,only above specified method could be used.

WebDriver have many useful and required methods like get,getTitle,close,quit,switchTo,etc. These webdriver methods cannot be used directly unless you downcast to Webdriver. So, it is advisable to use

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();


Explanation 2 - 
================
SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is page Factory ??

ANs : Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation.

public class DesiredCapabilityHandle {
	
	static WebDriver driver ;

		  System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", driverPath);
		 
		  driver=new ChromeDriver(); 
		  System.out.println("Chrome driver used"); 
		  
		  driver.get("https://www.cacert.com/");
		 
		  //Without using desired capability this site will ask you to accept certifications 
		  //Doing with automation canot be done without help of Desired Cap 
	
	}
		
	public void Case_With_DesiredCapability() {
		
		String driverPath = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe";
		  System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", driverPath);
		  
		DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
		caps.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true); // This will accept the certificates 
		
		  driver=new ChromeDriver(caps); 
		  System.out.println("Chrome driver used"); 
		  
		  driver.get("https://www.cacert.com/");
		  
		  //When Desired capabilty is used , your driver will automatically under what to handle 
		  //In above lines it will accept any insecure certification message 
		  //Desired cap is a class by selenium - whihc has inbuild functions/methods to handle such scanerios 
		  //Browsers like chrome/firefox /IE all have such capabalities like this 
		 
	}
	
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			DesiredCapabilityHandle DC = new DesiredCapabilityHandle();
			DC.Case_With_DesiredCapability();

Q:What Is Caching?

Answer: Caching refers to storing server responses in the client itself so that a client needs not to make a server request for the same resource again and again. A server response should have information about how caching is to be done so that a client caches the response for some time or never caches the server response.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Why string is immutable ?
Ans : 
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

The cached String literals are accessed by multiple clients. So, there is always a risk, where action performs by one client affects all other clients. For example, if one client performs an action and changes the string value from Pressure to PRESSURE, all remaining clients will also read that value. For the performance reason, caching of String objects was important, so to remove that risk, we have to make the String Immutable.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:*******Q:Explain the statements and also tell what is the differnce between both 

double a = 100 ;
double a = (double) 100;

Ans :: In first case , we are assigning value to variable a as 100 and data type of a is double .So the value will be like 100.00 and size will be of 8 byte 

In second case , we are type casting the value .Basically 100 jo hai woh int value hai usko double mein convert karne ke liye we re doing this .Int ka size 4 byte hota hai after casting it to double it will be chnage to 8 byte 

*****Implicit and explicit / up & downcasting  yaha woh use ho rha hai .
Int -----> double (Up casting)

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

Q:*******Use of import static org.hamcrest?

Ans : Hamcrest is a widely used framework for unit testing in the Java world.

Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read. For this, it provides additional matcher classes which can be used in test for example written with JUnit. You can also define custom matcher implementations.

To use Hamcrest matchers in your test you use the assertThat statement followed by one or several matchers.

Whenever we want to assert something we use hancrest , for example 
	Res.then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchema(ExpectedScheme));

Q:Who writes the feature file -----------QA / Dev / BA 
Q:Advantages of cucumber ----It has feature file which uses english like language and anyone read this w/o having any code knowledge
Q:Can we put implicit and explicit all together in same script ------------ 
Ans : Not a good practice , script slow hp jaeygi 

Setting Explicit Wait is important in cases where there are certain elements that naturally take more time to load. If one sets an implicit wait command, then the browser will wait for the same time frame before loading every web element. This causes an unnecessary delay in executing the test script.

Explicit wait is more intelligent, but can only be applied for specified elements. However, it is an improvement on implicit wait since it allows the program to pause for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

There is an error at the line “super.super.print();”. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members. It is allowed in C++ though.




It can be done as 

// filename Main.java
class Grandparent {
    public void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("Grandparent's Print()");
    }
}
 
class Parent extends Grandparent {

Q:Real example of Abstrction in sleenoum framework ?
Ans :
These concepts are commonly used in framework development. Abstract class is used in defining a common super class while writing Page Object Model layer of the framework. We usually create an abstract class named BasePage to have all common members for every page written in this class e.g getPageTitle().

Then each Page class (HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage etc.) inherit from BasePage. Sometimes one may need to change the behavior of methods implemented in superclass. So subclass has freedom to override that method where we use polymorphism. This is how we use Abstract class in real projects.

Q:******************Q:What are the changes introduced in interface after JDK 1.8?

Ans : Prior to java 8, interface in java can only have abstract methods. All the methods of interfaces are public & abstract by default. 

Java 8 allows the interfaces to have default and static methods.

Default method : For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface. In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface which we want to change but imagine if there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface then it would be almost impossible to change the code in all those classes. This is why in java 8, we have a new concept “default methods”. These methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily, thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static Methods : Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.

Q:What is Agile Methodology?
• In the Agile methodology, each project is broken up into several ‘Iterations’.
• AGILE is a methodology that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing 
throughout the software development life cycle of the project. Both development and testing 
activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model.
• All Iterations should be of the same time duration (between 2 to 8 weeks).
• At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered.
• Any remaining features that cannot be delivered in the first iteration will be taken up in the 
next iteration or subsequent iterations, based on priority.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Difference between defect, error, bug, failure and fault?

Q:Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

Q:Q:Spring backlog 

Ans : The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the Scrum sprint. During the sprint planning meeting, the team selects some number of product backlog items, usually in the form of user stories, and identifies the tasks necessary to complete each user story.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is Product Backlog ?
Ans : 
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  


In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.

Q:What is difference between sel 3 &4

Ans : The architecture for Selenium 3 includes the JSON Wire Protocol. However, Selenium 4 does not include the JSON Wire Protocol, and that’s the contrast between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON Protocol is used to transfer information between Selenium client (webDriver) and Browser driver 


Sekenium 4 ::
Selenium 4 has direct communication between the client and server. The client still has 2 parts (Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings) while Browser Drivers are the server.

Selenium Client sends out a request to perform a command.
The WebDriver Language Bindings is a code library designed to drive actions.
Browser Drivers receive the request and then return a response after an automation Test Script executes on the Web Browser:


Selenium4 is more stable then selenium 3.

Question: How is Webdriver beneficial over Selenium Server?
Answer: Webdriver does not require the Selenium Server because it uses a completely different technology. It provides Selenium RC functionality, which provides backward compatibility to Selenium 1.0. Also, it makes a direct call to the various browsers for making automation. At the same time, in the case of Selenium RC, it requires the Selenium Server to input the Javascript into the browser.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Define Vector in collections ?

Ans - Vector implements a dynamic array that means it can grow or shrink as required. 
Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index
They are very similar to ArrayList but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy method that the collection framework does not contain.
It also maintains an insertion order like an ArrayList 


===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector are all implementations of the List interface. Which of them is most efficient for adding and removing elements from the list? Explain your answer, including any other alternatives you may be aware of.

Ans 

Out Of the three, LinkedList is generally going to give you the best performance. Here’s why:

ArrayList and Vector each use an array to store the elements of the list. As a result, when an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly. Vector is synchronized, so if a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList rather than Vector.

LinkedList, on the other hand, is implemented using a doubly linked list. As a result, an inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed.

However, it is worth noting that if performance is that critical, it’s better to just use an array and manage it yourself, or use one of the high performance 3rd party packages such as Trove or HPPC.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you swap the values of two numeric variables without using any other variables?

Ams 
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:*****What is the difference between String s = "Test" and String s = new String("Test")? Which is better and why?

Ans -
In general, String s = "Test" is more efficient to use than String s = new String("Test").

In the case of String s = "Test", a String with the value “Test” will be created in the String pool. If another String with the same value is then created (e.g., String s2 = "Test"), it will reference this same object in the String pool.

However, if you use String s = new String("Test"), in addition to creating a String with the value “Test” in the String pool, that String object will then be passed to the constructor of the String Object (i.e., new String("Test")) and will create another String object (not in the String pool) with that value. Each such call will therefore create an additional String object (e.g., String s2 = new String("Test") would create an addition String object, rather than just reusing the same String object from the String pool).
===============================================================================================================================================
11. What is the difference between type keys and type commands?

Ans -TypeKeys() will trigger JavaScript events, while type() won’t. TypesKeys collects different value attributes using JavaScript. Whereas, the type commands imitate an actual user typing.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What is an exception test in Selenium?

Ans - An exception test is a test that looks forward to an exception to be thrown inside a test class. It anticipates the @Test annotation followed by the expected exception name. For example, @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class) is an exception test for missing elements in Selenium.

Note: Keep in mind the syntax, where the exception is suffixed with .class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How will you use Selenium to upload a file?

Ans - If the file is on the same machine or in a mapped network drive, it is really straightforward: We have to just type the ‘path’ of the file in the FileUpload control.

Example:

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
element = driver.find_element_by_id("fileUpload")
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")
===============================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How can you identify an object in Selenium?
Ans -We can use isElementPresent (string locator) to find an object in Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and, if found, returns a Boolean.

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object 
===============================================================================================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Can we throw an exception manually?

If yes, how?Yes, we can throw an exception manually using throw keyword. Syntax for throwing an exception manually isthrow InstanceOfThrowableType

Throwing exceptions manually
You can throw a user defined exception or, a predefined exception explicitly using the throw keyword.

There are two types of exceptions user defined and predefined each exception is represented by a class and which inherits the Throwable class.

To throw an exception explicitly you need to instantiate the class of it and throw its object using the throw keyword.

public class ExceptionExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
      NullPointerException nullPointer = new NullPointerException();
      throw nullPointer;
   }
}


Whenever you throw an exception explicitly you need to make sure that the line with throw keyword is the last line of the program. This is because any code written after it is unreachable code and if you still have code snippets below this line a compile time error will be generated.



Example 2


class ThrowExcep
{
    static void fun()
    {
        try
        {
            throw new NullPointerException("demo");
        }
        catch(NullPointerException e)
        {
            System.out.println("Caught inside fun().");
            throw e; // rethrowing the exception
        }
    }


===============================================================================================================================================

Q: When to use  concat and when to use plus in strings ?


public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s = "Gfg";
        s = s.concat("! is the best.");
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.

-----
public class Gfg {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String s1 = "Gfg";
        String s2 = "! is the best";
  
        String s3 = s1 + s2;
  
        System.out.println(s3);
    }
}

Output :: Gfg! is the best.



---------->Number of arguments the concat() method and + operator takes: <------------------

concat() method takes only one argument of string and concat it with other string.

+ operator takes any number of arguments and concatenates all the strings.


public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String s = "Geeks", t = "for", g = "geeks";
  
        System.out.println(s + t + g);
        System.out.println(s.concat(t));
    }
}

Output :
Geeksforgeeks
Geeksfor


---------------<Performance<----------------------
concat() method is better than + operator because it creates a new object only when the string length is greater than zero(0) but + operator always a creates a new string irrespective of length of string.

Q62. Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked.

Q:Difference in Automation testing/Tester and SDET (Software Design Engineer in test)
Automation Testing can be referred to role/designation as well as it is the term use to differentiate between Manual Testing and Automation Testing. You can say that I am in Automation Testing, I am Automation Tester, I am a Test Developer,Test Automation proffessional etc. But yes when it comes to the term SDET(Software Development/Design Engineer in Test) This refers to a role which has expertise in below aspects of Automation Testing (not mandatorily all but most of it):

Automation Framework Designing-Selenium, Cucumber, Siquili, AutoIT, RPM, Rest-Assured API, OK HTTP, etc

Coding/Scripting (Java,C#, Python, Pearl, Ruby etc)

CICD pipeline (continuous Integration Continuous Development/Delivery)- Jenkins, Maven,Bamboo etc. DevOps tools and practices -GitHub, Ansible, Docker etc.

Apart from all above, SDET must also be aware of QA practices, Like Agile, Waterfall, STLC SDLC, defect lifecycle, Diff Types of Testings, Testing situational dealings, Test Plan and artifacts etc.

Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

415 (Unsupported Media Type)
412 (Precondition Failed)
404 (Not Found)
401 (Unauthorized)
201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content
202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

Q:What is JDK --JRE + JDK

Q:Which is the latest version of Java - java 15 

Q:Javac and Java commands are available in which folder-----bin folder

Q:what will be the default value for global variables---------0

Q:What will be the default value for reference variables ----------No Default value

Q:What is the default value for the boolean variable ----------- False 

Q:Can we declare a final global variable and use it without initializing it? -----No

Q:What are the different types of inheritance-----Single , multiple and multi-level.

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)

driver.findElement(By.id(“login”)).sendkeys(user_name);
driver.findElement(By.id(“password”)).sendkeys(password);
}


Now, go to the testng.xml file and enter the parameters there as follows:

<Suite name = “suitename”>
<test name =”testname”>
<parameter name =”user_name” value=”user1”/>
<parameter password =”password” value =”pass1”/>

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

15. In Java what is the default value of an object reference defined as an
instance variable in an Object?

Ans -Instance variables have default values. For numbers, the default value is 0, for Booleans it is false, and for object references it is null. Values can be assigned during the declaration or within the constructor.
===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

Ans -Constructor cannot be static because it cannot be call as method or variable, so no need to placing a static variable before constructor. abstract means incomplete, for complementing it we need an implementation class/interface. Constructor doesn't required to be abstract because it doesn't need to be implemented.
===============================================================================
Q:33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

This way variables cannot be called in another class .
===============================================================================
35. Why do we mark main method as static in Java?
Ans -Java main() method is always static, so that compiler can call it without the creation of an object or before the creation of an object of the class
===============================================================================
43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return
type of method in java?

Overloading is the mechanism of binding the method call with the method body dynamically based on the parameters passed to the method call. ... It is not possible to decide to execute which method based on the return type, therefore, overloading is not possible just by changing the return type of the method.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

The abstract method testing in type AbstarctClassExample can only set a visibility modifier, one of public or protected

===============================================================================
62. Is it allowed to mark an interface method as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.
===============================================================================
What type of parameter passing does Java support?

In Java the arguments are always passed by value.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Ques.28. Explain the different types of specification based test design technique?
Ans. Specification based test design techniques are also referred to as blackbox testing. It involves testing based on the specification of the system under test without knowing its internal architecture. The different types of specification based test design or black box testing techniques are-

    Equivalence partitioning - Grouping test data into logical groups or equivalence classes with the assumpation that all the data items lying in the classes will     have same effect on the application.
    Boundary value analysis - Testing using the boundary values of the equivalence classes taken as the test input.
    Decision tables - Testing using decision tables showing application's behaviour based on different combination of input values.
    Cause-effect graph - Testing using graphical representation of input i.e. cause and output i.e. effect is used for test designing.
    State transition testing - Testing based on state machine model.
    Use case testing - Testing carried out using use cases.user action and system response.


Ques.34. What is use case testing?
Ans. A use case testing is a black box testing approach in which testing is carried out using use cases. A use case scenario is seen as interaction between the application and actors(users).



Ques.41). What are the different types of Integration testing?
Ans. The different type of integration testing are-

    Big bang Integration Testing - In big bang integration testing, testing starts only after all the modules are integrated.
    Top-down Integration Testing - In top down integration, testing/integration starts from top modules to lower level modules.
    Bottom-up Integration Testing - In bottom up integration, testing starts from lower level modules to higher level module up in the heirarchy.
    Hybrid Integration Testing - Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom up integration testing. In this approach, the integration         starts from middle layer and testing is carried out in both the direction

Q: What is Authentication / Autherization ?

Ans - 
Authentication / Authorization 

Authorization - user has rights or not 



for example 
ek hamari application hai ----aur ek outer application hai say Indigo ya british airlines --ab british airlines ya indogo ne apni API's expose ki hui hai so that koi bhe use kar sake , jaise hum (MMT ) hain we can also use the exposed api of indigo or british airlines 


Ab Britsh auirlines ya indogo ki api's hum directly use nahe kar sake , we should have the rights to consume it .


Types of Authentication ::

---- Basic authentication --------- username and password 
---- oAuth Authentication ----> you need to pass -----> Consumer Key , Consumer Secret ,Access Token ,Token Secret
---- Token Id / Bearer Token --- Ek API hit karke -> token id milegi --> you have to use it in API-Application ---here we need to pass the token in the postman_collection
---- oAuth2 ----> Only token need to be passed 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Authentication examples 


Always go to offcial document like jira api documentation 

Example of basic Authentication ::::

given().auth()
  .basic("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  .get("http://localhost:8080/spring-security-rest-basic-auth/api/foos/1")
  .then()
  .assertThat()
  .statusCode(HttpStatus.OK.value());
  
  
  
  Ex 2 : 
  
  given().auth()
  .oauth2(accessToken)
  .when()

Q:What is a RESTFul Web Services?
Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): An XML-based method to expose web services.

REST (Representational State Transfer): Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the most popular way to represent a resource in REST?

REST uses different representations to define a resource like text, JSON, and XML.
XML and JSON are the most popular representations of resources.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Which protocol is used by RESTful Web services?

RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between the client and the server.
===============================================================================================================================================
What are the core components of an HTTP request?
An HTTP request contains five key elements:

An action showing HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is the identifier for the resource on the server.
HTTP Version, which indicates HTTP version, for example-HTTP v1.1.
Request Header, which carries metadata (as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message. Metadata could be a client (or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of a message body format, cache settings, and so on.
Request Body, which indicates the message content or resource representation.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Is there any difference between PUT and POST operations?

Q: Difference between PUT and Patch
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the upper limit for a payload to pass in the POST method?

Ans -So, theoretically, a user can pass unlimited data as the payload to POST method. But, if we consider a real use case, then sending POST with large payload will consume more bandwidth. It’ll take more time and present performance challenges to your server. Hence, a user should take action accordingly.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain what is REST and RESTFUL?

REST represents REpresentational State Transfer; it is a relatively new aspect of writing web API.

RESTFUL is referred for web services written by applying REST architectural concept are called RESTful services, it focuses on system resources and how state of resource should be transported over HTTP protocol to different clients written in different language. In RESTFUL web service HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE can be used to perform CRUD operations.

===============================================================================================================================================
****Explain the architectural style for creating web API?

The architectural style for creating web api are

HTTP for client server communication
XML/JSON as formatting language
Simple URI as the address for the services
Stateless communication

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Mention some key characteristics of REST?

Some key characteristics of REST includes

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ention which markup language can be used in restful web api?

JSON and XML are the two markup language that can be used in restful web api
===============================================================================================================================================

Q:What is the template available to send and receive data thru API

Post -> given().contentType(contenttype.JSON).body(bodyData).when().post(URI);

Get --->given().contentType(contenttype.JSON).when().get(URI);
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How will you handle server issues in API testing both in postman and rest assured.. like 5xx.. explain

Ans - Causes 
1.Proxy issues 
2.Server Down / Unavailable /wrong server approached 


Check the backend server and secondly try to hit the service after sometime 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What’s the diff between Rest vs SOAP

Rest uses URI , Soap uses WDSL file 
Rest has capability to handle exceptions , soap dnt have 
Rest uses json/xml, soap uses xml
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the different ways you validate the rest of API response

In postman under test tab -> you can check the status by using chai assertions 
Also do validations for header and header content 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Different ways to read JSON file ?
Ans - org.json 
pojo class 
jsonpath
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Explain your Rest Assured automation framework? 

Ans 
com.Resources -------------------------- JSON file , file will have extension .JSON
com.utility   -------------------------- PropertyFileReader , JSONFileReader
com.TestSuite -------------------------- HTTPMethods 
com.Testcases -------------------------- TestCases which will call HTTPMethods
URI.properties File -------------------- This will have Key:Value , example :: QA_URI:https://localhost:8080

Q:
==================================================Interview Question on API Naveen =============================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: API ?

Application progm interface , which helps to interact 2 diff applications or allows interface between DB & UI .You pass a body and in return you get the status/response to that .

Companies like twitter ,ola , uber , amazon all are using api's of some company 


API helps to perform function as well as non functional testing .Non Func like reliablity  ,performance and security (taki koi hacker na hack kar le).

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What are the limits of API ?

Ans - 
Many Api has some limitations based on the provider , they try to understand what all type of data (jaise emirates flight ki api make my trip tya yatra use karti hai , to es case mein mmt ya yatra consumer hui and emirates providees).

Provider sochega ki data share karne se kitna mera data secure rhega , kya share karna hai aur kis limits mein 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Example of API 

Ans - Let says there is app say uber , now uber cabs requires some sort of map to run their cars .Uber will not go and create their map , they will use someones else api say google map or apple map .They will link their api's with google map api's and this is how it works in real world .

Another example is Yatra , MMT , Trivago all are using api from other companies / providers say : lemontree hotels , lalit hotels , JW marriot hotels and so on .In addtion they also uses api from other companies like ---> emirates , jetairway and so on
===============================================================================================================================================
Q; Who all can use API's ?

Ans - Any client whihc supports http methods - put , get , delete , post , put can use it .Even a mobile can use any api
===============================================================================================================================================
Q: Advantages of API testing 

1.Intial level par he es backend testing se aap bugs find kar sakte ho , save lots of money and time 
2.Very quick and fast as compared to UI 
3.Cost effectve 
4.You can run plethora of API test in very short span of time 
5.very less maintance if scripts as no xpath change chances are there

Q:Explain in brief the different types of output observed of an API. –

Ans - JSON, XML, HTML, text

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will you check first when a lot of failures in API automation?

Q:

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: What al to test in API's ?
Ans 

1.Verify correct HTTP status code. For example, creating a resource should return 201 CREATED and unpermitted requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.

2. Verify response payload. Check valid JSON body and correct field names, types, and values — including in error responses.

3. Verify response headers. HTTP server headers have implications on both security and performance.

4. Verify correct application state. This is optional and applies mainly to manual testing, or when a UI or another interface can be easily inspected.  

5. Verify basic performance sanity. If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test fails.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What will be your action, when a mandatory header which is passed in all the services becomes optional?

Ams pehle woh gloval variable that , ab ushe hum env variable banna denge

            "id": "2"
        }
]
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is difference between digest and basic authentication ?

Ans Digest Authentication communicates credentials in an encrypted form by applying a hash function to: the username, the password, a server supplied nonce value, the HTTP method and the requested URI.

Whereas Basic Authentication uses non-encrypted base64 encoding.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q: How the bearer toekn can be passed in rest assured ?

Ans - Using oath2 

given().contentType(contentType.JSON).body().auth().oauth2("-------").when().get("---------------");

Response Res = given().contentType(contentType.JSON).auth().oauth1("","","","").when().post(---);
===============================================================================================================================================
When you login to a site say makemytrip , you can also login using google or facebook .In that case google/facebook will not pass all the information to the makemytrip site ,only
username and password is passed.

Q:********What is Name Space and its usage

Ans :  A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
consider a system of naming of people where each person has a given name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just "Jane" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the "global" namespace of all people, the full name must be used.

===============================================================================================================================================
:********what is Difference b/w Listiterator and Iterator

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Where do you use a hashmap?
Ans: Maps are used for when you want to associate a key with a value and Lists are an ordered collection. Map is an interface in the Java Collection Framework and a HashMap is one implementation of the Map interface. HashMap are efficient for locating a value based on a key and inserting and deleting values based on a key. HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

// Add elements to the map
map.put(“vishal”, 10);
map.put(“sachin”, 30);
map.put(“vaibhav”, 20);

// Print size and content
System.out.println(“Size of map is:- ”
+ map.size());
System.out.println(map);

// Check if a key is present and if
// present, print value

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

Q:How do you manage to re-run only failed test cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Data Binding in Java ?
Ans :Data Binding
If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

public class GFG {
    
  //static instance of class globally accessible
  public static GFG instance = new GFG();
  private GFG() {
    // private constructor so that class

===============================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================
Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.


package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase1()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase1");  
 }  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase2()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase2");  
 }  
 @Test(dependsOnGroups="test")  
 public void testcase3()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase3");  
 }  
}  

===============================================================================
What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 

===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

===============================================================================
Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 

===============================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.

===============================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 

===============================================================================
Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 

===============================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Abstract methods in selenium webdriver?

Selenium WebDriver interface has many abstract methods like get(String url), quit(), close(), getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles(), getTitle() etc.

===============================================================================
Q:Difference git pull and git fetch ?

git fetch pulls latest changes done by other devs from remote reporsiroty to local repo and then you have to run merge command to merge the changes in your local

git pull -Download and merges the changes in your local.
===============================================================================
Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

===============================================================================

		WebElement hoverToSee = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[contains(text(),'Hover me to see')]"));
		Actions action = new Actions(driver);
	
	
		action.moveToElement(hoverToSee);
		action.clickAndHold(hoverToSee).build().perform();
		
		
		WebElement tt = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(@class,'tooltip')]"));
	String ttt = tt.getText();
	System.out.print("Text Extracted = " + ttt);
	Boolean abc = tt.isDisplayed();
	}

===============================================================================
Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

===============================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.

===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===============================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

JIT => BC ->Instructions

10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.

================================================Latest Questions added on 6th Aprl===============================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

 @Before("@First")
    public void beforeFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the First Scenario");
    } 
 
 @Before("@Second")
    public void beforeSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the Second Scenario");
    } 
 
 
 @After("@First")
    public void afterFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the First Scenario");   
    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.
501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 
500 (Internal Server Error)
415 (Unsupported Media Type)
412 (Precondition Failed)
404 (Not Found)
401 (Unauthorized)
201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content
202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

Q:What will be the default value for reference variables ----------No Default value

Q:What is the default value for the boolean variable ----------- False 

Q:Can we declare a final global variable and use it without initializing it? -----No

Q:What are the different types of inheritance-----Single , multiple and multi-level.

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q #3) How to run the TestNG script?

Right-click on the class in Eclipse, click on “Run as” and select “TestNG test”.

Right click on testNG.XML file --> Run as TestNG.suite
===============================================================================
--Squence of execution in TestNG

@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@Aftertest
@AfterSuite
===============================================================================
Q #10) What is a dependency on TestNG?

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)
Then the test case will run without failing.
===============================================================================
Q #17) How to pass parameter in the test case through the testng.xml file?

@Parameters({"user_name","password"})
@Test
public void loginapp()
{
driverget(“appname”);
driver.findElement(By.id(“login”)).sendkeys(user_name);
driver.findElement(By.id(“password”)).sendkeys(password);
}


Now, go to the testng.xml file and enter the parameters there as follows:

<Suite name = “suitename”>
<test name =”testname”>
<parameter name =”user_name” value=”user1”/>
<parameter password =”password” value =”pass1”/>
<Classes>
<class name =”passingparameters”/>
<classes/>
<test/>
<Suite/>
===============================================================================
Q #19) How to create an XML file in TestNG?

Answer: Go to the src folder -> click on file ->enter the name of the file(mostly written testing.xml)

Then, Click on finish.

We have a blank XML file. Here, we have to mention the project name and the classes to be executed along with the package name as shown below.

<Suite name = "Testing project">
<test name = "testing feature 1">
<classes>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
</classes>
</test>
</Suite>
===============================================================================
Q #20) How to throw a SKIP Exception in TestNG?

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )
public class FailedScenarios {

}

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What do you mean by User Defined Exception?
Ans: User Defined Exception or custom exception is creating your own exception class and throws that exception using ‘throw’ keyword. This can be done by extending the class Exception. … The keyword “throw” is used to create a new Exception and throw it to the catch block.

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:How many phases are there in maven build cycle?
Ans: 6 validate-compile-test-package-install-deploy

===============================================================================================================================================
How to run single method multiple time in TestNG?
Ans ->We have invocation count attribute in @test annotiation. We can write invocation count as 3 if we want to run it 3 times. Apart from that we can write threadpull.size if we want to run that case in multiple thread.

 @Test(invocationCount = 3)
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between scenario & scenario outline?
Ans: When we have single scenario and we need to run it one time at that place we use Scenario.
If you want some parametrization or Data Driven testing at that time, we can use scenario outline where we have to use Example keyword like if we are running this scenario for 3 different data set like username & pass. so, it will run 3 times.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the use of Dry Run in cucumber?
Ans: Dry run is not running our whole application it will check whether all features are mapped with Step definition.

===============================================================================================================================================

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

Q:What is Data Binding in Java ?
Ans :Data Binding
If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

Q:Selenium Grid ?
Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes

Hub enables simultaneous execution of tests on multiple machines, managing different browsers centrally, instead of conducting different tests for each of them. Selenium Grid makes cross browser testing easy as a single test can be carried on multiple machines and browsers, 
all together, making it easy to analyze and compare the results.

public void m1(String SS ) ----kal yeh method ko aap reuse karna chaho aur aap es mein 2 string ya 2 int aur pass karna chaho to
aur you want to use concept of reuse how can be done 

Ans - 1.Method Overloading jaise 
public void m1(String SS ) 
public void m2(String SS , Int a ) 


2nd Way ::
always declare argument like 

public void m1(Object.. Obj)=======>>==============>>

Q:What is Data Binding in Java ?
Ans :Data Binding
If you need coffee to wake up in the morning, a couple of items are very important to you: coffee in the cup and a little caffeine in the coffee! You can't drink a concept, you need to have the drink.

In Java, we can create a class for Coffee, but until we link up the class with variables, methods, constructors, and 
such, it's just a class. Let's say we add variables for bean count, caffeine content, and ounces. When you create a new instance of a class and access one of the underlying variables, these items are bound together. This is data binding. In this case, it would be taking the Coffee class and, say, 
accessing the caffeine variable. That would be data binding in our example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Singleton class ?
Ans : Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

public class GFG {
    
  //static instance of class globally accessible

Q:Explain how hashmap works ?
Ans - HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. It implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value. HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class. It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields in HashMap.

It is the process of converting an object into an integer value. The integer value helps in indexing and faster searches.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Difference in Iterator and List<Iterator>?
Ans - Iterator :
1.Can move in forward direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
2.Cannot add or remove element

List<Iterator> :
1.Can move in forward and reverse  direction-Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward and Reverse direction.
2.Can add or remove element

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:what is Iterator in java?

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Make a collection
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");

    // Get the iterator
    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();

    // Print the first item
    System.out.println(it.next());
  }
}

Q:How To Set The Priority Of Cucumber Hooks?
Ans 
@Before(order = int): This runs in increment order, means value 0 would run first and 1 would be after 0
@After(order = int): This runs in decrements order, which means the opposite of @Before. Value 1 would run first and 0 would be after 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:--Suppose ther are 100 scamerios and using hooks i want to run it for 5 only .How this can be possible ?

import cucumber.api.java.After;
import cucumber.api.java.Before;
 
public class Hooks {
 
 @Before
    public void beforeScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run before the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @After
    public void afterScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run after the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @Before("@First")
    public void beforeFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the First Scenario");
    } 
 
 @Before("@Second")
    public void beforeSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the Second Scenario");
    } 
 
 
 @After("@First")
    public void afterFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the First Scenario");   
    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.


===Note ::
We can also indicate if we want before and after hooks to be executed with a specific tag only. Example − @Before(‘@Web’). The same concept of tag logical and/or can be applied with hooks as well. Example − @Before(@dev,@wip), @Before(@dev,~@wip)

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.
------------------------------------------------API Questions------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Challanges faced in API testing ?
Ans : 1.Documentation - we need lot of documents like api , endpoints , URI , authentication keys , headers 
2.Access to DB - you hit a URI -> get response , how to validate response is as per expectation or not .specially jab api 3rd party ki ho , us case mein
we dnt have their server access .
3.Authentication --> dekhna padega kaise token milega , search karna padega 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:List out authentication techniques ?
Ans -Basic --usernanme and Password 
OAuth1 --Consumerkey , secretKey , --, --
OAuth2--token
Digest--usernanme and Password.But in encrypted form

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Why API is the best way to automate the things 
Ans -1.Lighter 
2.No need to update scripts as used to in case of UI , as xpath nahe hota koi
3.Early response 
4.Cost Effective 
5.Early stage par he user comes to know if the things working fine or not
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Rest API.
Ans - Set of functions/ API's where user sends a request and gets the response in return . Based on the response code we can come to knwo if the api is 
working fine or not .
It can act between 2 differnt platforms , mobile & web , 2 differnt languages 

Verfication to be done ::
1.Response code 
2.Response Time 
3.Header / Body 
4.Security - checking the authentication 
5.Errors if any

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:How do you represent a resource in rest?
Ans : Using HTTP method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What are the main file components of Automation framework in rest assured ?
Ans:
com.Resources------------------------ all the json files with extension .JSON
com.TestSuite------------------------ all httpmethods

Q:Name the superclass in Java.
Java.lang. All different non-primitive are inherited directly or indirectly from this class.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 
===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

Q:What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.

Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
==============================================================================================================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?
Since an array is static in nature i.e. you cannot change the size of an array once created, So, if you need an array which can resize itself then you should use the ArrayList.

Q:What si resource in API ?
Ans : Resource can be test file , html , image , server , service , video 

Resouces can be identified by URI
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is stalelessness in rest API ?
Ans : Ideally in API , it should not keep a client state on server this restriction is called statelessness.
Staless means each request goes as a seperate trasaction , it doesnot retain the previous trasaction

Http is stateless transaction , it doesnot allows server to save the previous transaction
===============================================================================================================================================
Q:What is accept and content type in Http
Ans - Accept tells webservices what kind of response client is acceptins .jaise webservices is capable of sending xml/json format then accpt header as application/xml then xml response will be sent

 content type- tells what type/ format of data is sent in the request .if content type of data is application/xml then server will parse the data into xml.

Q:Mention some key characteristics of REST?

Some key characteristics of REST includes

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:ention which markup language can be used in restful web api?

JSON and XML are the two markup language that can be used in restful web api

$.store.*------------Sab kuch display hoga jo bhe array ya object hai store ke under
$.store.book[0]------------yeh book array ka pehle record display karega 
$.store.book[*]------------display all the array values jo book ke under hai , chahe us mein 5 objects ho ya kuch bhe 
$.store.book[*].title------------display all the title  values jo book ke under hai , chahe us mein 5 objects ho ya kuch bhe 
$.store..title ------------------ here .. (recirsion patter)-- displays all the title in the json under store 


Suppose strore ke under book array hai , and book array mein 3 objects hain ,you want to display all the records of that book array do 

$.store.book[*]

if you want to display one first record of the book do 

$.store.book[1]

agar pehle 2 records display karne ho to book array mein se .........>>>>>

$.store.book[0,1]-----------------------> vvvvimp ----> yeh pehle 2 he records display karega 


if you want to have category out of above two books , do it as 
$.store.book[0,1].category



if i want to display all the books data , do like
$..book


if you want to display in thw range say 1,2 ,3,4,5 record karna hai out of 10 record use :
$.store.book[0:4] 
Note : hoghes range yaha 4 ayegi as aapko 5 records tak chaiye

Q:What is Hybrid Framework?
Hybrid Driven Framework is a mix of both the Data-Driven and Keyword Driven frameworks.

In this case, the keywords as well as the test data, are externalized. Keywords are stored in a separate Java class file and test data can be maintained in a Properties file or an Excel file.

Q:Why webdriver is used as interface not abstract class ?
WebDriver could be an abstract class as well but idea behind making WebDriver is an interface for better architectural design.

An interface is similar to an abstract class; An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill. An interface definition consists of signatures of public members, without any implementing code.

Interface is empty shell with only method signatures or constant value. It contains which are implemented by other class.

Abstract class is a class which can have its own behavior + abstract method signatures.

Webdriver itself doesn't have any behavior but it defines what other implementing class should behave like firefox, chrome or IEdriver.

So maybe thats why Webdriver is a Interface

Q:Api vs WebServices 

Ans : 
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

Q:Trobleshooting in API?

Ans 
Is the URL correct?
Is the API key valid? - Each user has a unique key.
Is the authorization header valid?
Are the request parameters valid?
Did the API call return the expected results?
Did the API call return the expected results with expected performance 

===============================================================================================================================================
Q:Auth vs autherization 

Ans 
Authentication is when an entity proves an identity. In other words, Authentication proves that you are who you say you are. This is like having a driver license which is given by a trusted authority that the requester, such as a police officer, can use as evidence that suggests you are in fact who you say you are.

Authorization is an entirely different concept and in simple terms, Authorization is when an entity proves a right to access. In other words, Authorization proves you have the right to make a request. Consider the following - You have a working key card that allows you to open only some doors in the work area, but not all of them.


In summary:
Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity
Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action

Q:How to check security in API's 

Ans: 
4 Quick Ways to Test if Your API is Secure

    1. Parameter tampering
    2. Injection
    3. Input Fuzzing
    4. Unhandled HTTP Methods
	
1. Parameter tampering

Parameter tampering is when an attacker changes the values in an API request. This type of attack takes advantage of hidden parameters used in API requests to pass “secure” information. For example, this could be used to change the purchase price of a product by changing the value assigned to the price or cost parameter. 
To test if parameter tampering is possible, you can examine any API related elements in your site or web app through the development console in your browser. If you change the value in your console, submit it with the included change, and the application accepts it, your API is not secure. 


2. Injection

An injection attack occurs when an attacker inserts hostile input into an API. A common example is SQL injection, where SQL queries or commands are submitted, in the hope that they will be run against the backend database.

Another common example is command injection, where an attacker inserts commands into a request or input. When processed, these commands are read by the receiving system as separate from the request, and are executed as standalone commands. 

Attackers can use these attacks for many malicious purposes, including gaining access to systems through privilege escalation, rebooting devices, or deleting data.

To test if your API is vulnerable to command injection, you can try submitting a request like the following:


3. Input Fuzzing

Input fuzzing is performed by providing random information to an API through automation until an unexpected effect occurs. Often, the application will crash. Other effects might include an error message indicating that an input was partially valid. 
When performing fuzz tests, the two most common inputs to target are numbers and strings. To test number inputs, you should try submitting numbers outside the expected range, such as negative numbers, very large numbers, or decimal numbers. To test strings you can send very large strings, or strings with unexpected unicode.

Fuzzing reveals an application’s vulnerability to being remotely crashed by an attacker. It is unlikely to reveal significant weaknesses that an attacker could exploit, but is stlil useful in testing the robustness of an application



4.Unhandled HTTP Methods
To test if unsecure or unintended methods are allowed, try sending requests with known but unused and arbitrary methods. If either gets a valid response rather than an error (such as 405 or 501) you need to block those methods.
