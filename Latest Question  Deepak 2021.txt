Q:Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
