Q:Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

*Difference between Git pull and Git clone?*
We use these two commands to get changes from central repository. For the first time if you want whole central repository in your local server, we use git clone. It brings entire repository to your local server. Next time onwards you might want only changes instead of whole repository. In this case, we use Git
pull.
Git clone is to get whole copy of central repository
Git pull is to get only new changes from central repository (Incremental data)

*What is the difference between Git pull and Fetch?*
We use Git pull command to get changes from central repository. In this operation, internally two commands will get executed. One is Git fetch and
another one is Git merge.
Git fetch means, only bringing changes from central repo to local repo. But these changes will not be integrated to local repo which is there in your server. Git merge means, merging changes to your local repository which is there in your server. Then only you can see these changes.
So Git pull is the combination of Git pull and Git merge.
 
*What is the difference between Git merge and rebase?*
We often use these commands to merge code in multiple branches. Both are almost same but few differences. When you run Git merge, one new merge commit will be generated which is having the history of both development branches. It preserves the history of both branches. By seeing this merge
commit, everyone will come to know that we merged two branches. If you do Git rebase, commits in new branch will be applied on top of base branch tip. There won’t be any merge commit here. It appears that you started working in one single branch form the beginning. This operation will not preserves the history of new branch.
 
*What is Git Bisect?*
Git Bisect we use to pick bad commit out of all good commits. Often developers do some mistakes. For them it is very difficult to pick that commit where mistake is there. They go with building all commits one by one to pick bad commit. But Git bisect made their lives easy. Git bisect divides all commits
equally in to two parts (bisecting equally). Now instead of building each commit, they go with building both parts. Where ever bad commit is there, that part build will be failed. We do operation many times till we get bad commit. So Git bisect allows you to find a bad commit out of good commits. You don’t have to trace down the bad commit by hand; git-bisect will do that for you.
 

*What is Git squash?*
To move multiple commits into its parent so that you end up with one commit.
If you repeat this process multiple times, you can reduce “n” number of commits to a single one. Finally we will end up with only one parent commit. We use this operation just to reduce number of commits.
 
*What is Git hooks?*
We often call this as web hooks as well. By default we get some configuration
files when you install git. These files we use to set some permissions and notification purpose. We have different types of hooks (pre commit hooks & post commit hooks)
Pre-commit hooks:- Sometimes you would want every member in your team to follow certain pattern while giving commit message. Then only it should allow
them to commit. These type of restrictions we call pre-commit hooks.
Post-commit hooks:- Sometimes, being a manager you would want an email notification regarding every commit occurs in a central repository. This kind of things we call post-commit hooks.
In simple terms, hooks are nothing but scripts to put some restrictions.
 
*What is Git cherry-pick?*
When you go with git merge, all commits which are there in new development branch will be merged into current branch where you are. But sometimes, requirement will be in such that you would want to get only one commit form development branch instead of merging all commits. In this case we go with git cherry-pick. Git cherry-pick will pick only one commit whatever you select and merges with commits which are there in your current branch. So picking
particular commit and merging into your current branch we call git cherry-pick.
 
*What is the difference between Git and SVN?*
SVN:-
It is centralized version control system (CVCS) where back up copy will be placed in only one central repository.
There is no branching strategy in SVN. You can’t create branches. So no parallel development.
There is no local repository. So can’t save anything locally. Every time after writing code you need to push that code to central repository immediately to save changes.
Git:-
It is a Distributed version control system where back up copy is available in everyone’s machine’s local repository as well as a central repository.
We can create any no of branches as we want. So we can go in parallel development simultaneously.
Every Git repository will have its own local repository. So we can save changes
locally. At the end of our work finally, we can push code to a central repository.
