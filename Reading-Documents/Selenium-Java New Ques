Q:Compare the sleep() and wait() methods in Java, including when and why you would use one vs. the other.

Ans -sleep() is a blocking operation that keeps a hold on the monitor / lock of the shared object for the specified number of milliseconds.

wait(), on the other hand, simply pauses the thread until either (a) the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed or
 (b) it receives a desired notification from another thread (whichever is first), without keeping a hold on the monitor/lock of the shared object.

sleep() is most commonly used for polling, or to check for certain results, at a regular interval. wait() is generally used in multithreaded applications, in conjunction with notify() / notifyAll(), to achieve synchronization and avoid race conditions.

130 Selenium Interview Question & Answer Updated
Well, As Software QA Testers Are Searching Online To Get the Latest Interview Question and Answer Which Are Commonly Ask In The Interviews. So I Am Sure, this doc is not going to help you crack that interview, but I know there are many interviewers out there who want to know the answer to one-liner Selenium interview questions. You could use this questionnaire as a resource to tests your Selenium skills once you have gained enough knowledge in the Selenium suite of tools. Most of the questions are derived from the SeleniumHQ Doc and the Google wiki of the Selenium project.

Generic Selenium Questions
What is Selenium?
Answer: Selenium is a browser automation tool that lets you automate operations like – Type, Click, and Selection from a drop-down of a web page.

How is Selenium different from commercial browser automation tools?
Answer: Selenium is a library that is available in Various languages, i.e. Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. while most commercial tools are limited in their capabilities of being able to use just one language. Moreover, many of those tools have their language, which is of little use outside the domain of those tools. Most commercial tools focus on record and replay while Selenium emphasis using Selenium IDE (Selenium record and replay) tool ONLY to get acquainted with Selenium working and then move on to other Selenium libraries like Remote control [RC] (Selenium 1.0) and Web Driver (Selenium 2.0). Though most commercial tools have built-in capabilities of test reporting, error recovery mechanisms and Selenium does not provide any such features by default. But given the rich set of languages available with Selenium, it very easy to emulate such features.

What is the set of tools available with Selenium?
Answer: Selenium has mainly four sets of tools – Selenium IDE, Selenium 1.0 (Selenium RC), Selenium 2.0 (WebDriver), and Selenium Grid.

Which Selenium Tool should I use?
Answer: It entirely boils down to where you stand today in terms of using Selenium. If you are altogether new to Selenium, then you should begin with Selenium IDE to learn Selenium location strategies and then move to Selenium 2 as it is the most stable Selenium library and future of Selenium. Use Selenium Grid when you want to distribute
your test across multiple devices. If you are already using Selenium 1.0 then you should begin to migrate your
test scripts to Selenium 2.0

What is Selenium IDE?
Answer: Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin which is used to record and replay test in firefox browser. Selenium IDE can be used only with the Firefox browser.

Which language is used in Selenium IDE?
Answer: Selenium IDE uses an HTML sort of language called Selenese. Though other languages (java, c#, PHP, etc.) cannot be used with Selenium IDE, Selenium IDE lets you convert test in these languages so that they could be used
with Selenium 1.0 or Selenium 2.0

What is Selenium 1.0?
Answer: Selenium 1.0 or Selenium Remote Control (popularly known as Selenium RC) is a library available in a wide variety of languages. The primary reason for the advent of Selenium RC was the incapability of Selenium IDE to execute tests
in a browser other than Selenium IDE and the programmatical limitations of language Selenese used in Selenium
IDE.

What is Selenium 2.0?
Answer: Selenium 2.0, also known as WebDriver, is the latest offering of Selenium. It provides

Better API than Selenium 1.0
Does not suffer from javascript security restriction which Selenium 1.0 does
Supports more UI complicated UI operations like drag and drop
What are the element locators available with Selenium, which could be used to locate elements on a web page?
Answer: There are mainly 4 locators used with Selenium

Html ID
Html Name
Html Tagname
Html Class Name
XPath locator
CSS locators
Link Text
Partial Link Text
What is Selenium Grid?
Answer: Selenium grid lets you distribute your tests on multiple machines and all of them at the same time. Hence you can execute tests on IE on Windows and Safari on Mac machine using the same test script (well, almost always).
This greatly helps in reducing the time of test execution and provides quick feedback to stack holders.

Selenium IDE Questions
What are the two modes of views in Selenium IDE?
Answer:  Selenium IDE can be opened either in sidebar (View > Sidebar > Selenium IDE) or as a pop up window (Tools > Selenium IDE). While using Selenium IDE in the browser sidebar, it cannot record user operations in a pop-up
the window opened by an application.

Can I control the speed and pause test execution in Selenium IDE?
Answer: Selenium IDE provides a slider with Slow and Fast pointers to control the speed of execution.

Where do I see the results of Test Execution in Selenium IDE?
Answer: The result of test execution can be viewed in a log window in Selenium IDE

Where do I see the description of commands used in Selenium IDE?
Answer: Commands of description can be seen in the Reference section

Can I build a test suite using Selenium IDE?
Answer: Yes, you can first record individual test cases and then group all of them in a test suite. Following this entire test suite could be executed instead of executing individual tests.

What verification points are available with Selenium?
Answer: There are largely three types of verification points available with Selenium

Check for the page title
Check for certain text
Check for the certain element (text box, drop-down, table, etc.)
I see two types of the check with Selenium – verification, an assertion, what’s the difference between the two?
Answer: A verification check lets test execution continue even in the wake of failure with a check, while assertion stops the test execution. Consider an example of checking the text on a page, and you may like to use the verification point and let test execution continue even if a text is not present. But for a login page, you would like to add an assertion for the presence of text box login as it does not make sense to continue with test execution if the login text box is not present.

I don’t see checkpoints added to my tests while using Selenium IDE, how do I get them added to my tests?
Answer: You need to use the context menu to add checkpoints to your Selenium IDE tests.

How do I edit tests in Selenium IDE?
Answer:  There are two ways to edit tests in Selenium IDE; one is the table view while others are looking into the source code of recorded commands.

What is the syntax of the command used in Selenium?
Answer: There are three entities associated with a command

Name of Command
Element Locator (also known as Target)
Value (required when using echo, wait, etc.)
There are tons of Selenium Command, am I going to use all of them?
Answer: This entirely boils down to operations you are carrying out with Selenium. Though you would be using the following Selenium Commands more often

Open: opens a web page.
Click/clickAndWait: click on an element and waits for a new page to load.
Select: Selects a value from a drop-down value.
VerifyTitle/assertTitle: verifies/asserts page title.
Verify/assert ElementPresent: verifies/asserts presence of element, in the page.
Verify/assert TextPresent:  verifies/asserts expected text is somewhere on the page.
How do I use HTML id and name while using Selenium IDE?
Answer: Html id and name can be used as it is in selenium IDE. For example, the Google search box has a name – “q” and id  “listb,” and they can be used as a target in Selenium IDE

What is XPath? When would I have to use XPath in Selenium IDE?
Answer: XPath is a way to navigate in an XML document, and this can be used to identify elements in a web page. You may have to use XPath when there is no name/is associated with the element on the page, or only a partial part of name/ide is
constant.

The direct child is denoted with /
The relative child is denoted with //
Id, class, names can also be used with XPath –
· //input[@name=’q’]
· //input[@id=’lstib’]
· //input[@class=’ lst’]
If only part of id/name/class is constant then “contains” can be used as –
· //input[contains(@id,’lstib’)]
What is the CSS location strategy in Selenium?
Answer:  CSS location strategy can be used with Selenium to locate elements, it works using cascade style sheet location methods in which Direct child is denoted with – (space) Relative child is denoted with > Id, class, names can also be used with XPath –
· css=input[name=’q’]
· css=input[id=’lstib’]
or input#lstib
· css=input[class=’ lst’] or input.lst
If only part of id/name/class is constant then “contains” can be used as –
· css=input[id*=’ lstib
‘)]
Element location strategy using inner text
· CSS = a:contains(‘log out’)

There is an id, name, XPath, CSS locator, which one should I use?
Answer: If there are constant names/IDs available, then they should be used instead of XPath and CSS locators. If not, then CSS locators should be given preference as their evaluation is faster than XPath in most modern browsers.

I want to generate random numbers, dates as my test data, how do I do this in Selenium IDE?
Answer: This can be achieved by executing javascript in Selenium. Javascript can be executed using the following syntax –
type
css=input#s
javascript{Math.random()}
And for a date –
type
css=input#s
javascript{new Date()}

Can I store the result of an evaluation and use it later in my test?
Answer: You can use the “store” command to achieve this. You can save the result of an evaluation in a variable and use it later in your Selenium IDE script. For example, we can store a value from a text box as following and later use it to
type it in another text box –
storeText
css=input#s
var1
type
css=input#d
${var1}

I have stored the result of an evaluation; can I print it in IDE to check its value?
Answer: You can use the echo command as following to check the stored value in Selenium IDE –
storeText
css=input#s
var1
echo
${var1}

Can I handle a javascript alert using Selenium?
Answer: You could use verify/assertAlert to check the presence of an alert on the page. Since selenium cannot click on the “Ok” button on the js alert window, the alert itself does not appear on the page when this check is carried out.

Selenium has recorded my test using XPath, how do I change them to CSS locator?
Answer: You can use the drop-down available next to Find in Selenium to change the element locator used by Selenium

I have written my element locator, how do I test it?
Answer: You can use the Find button of Selenium IDE to test your locator. Once you click on it, you would see element being highlighted on the screen provided your element locator is right Else one error message would be displayed in the log
window.

I have written one js extension; can I plug it in Selenium and use it?
Answer: You could specify a js extension in the “Options” window of Selenium IDE –

How do I convert my Selenium IDE tests from Selenese to another language?
Answer: You could use the Format option of Selenium IDE to convert tests in another programming language –

I have converted my Selenium IDE tests to java, but I am not able to execute them, execution options, as well as the Table tab of Selenium IDE, is disabled
Answer: This is because Selenium IDE does not support the execution of the test in any other language than Selenese
(the language of Selenium IDE). You can convert Selenium IDE in a language of your choice and then use
Selenium 1.0 to execute these tests in that language.

I want to use only Selenese as my test script language but still want to execute tests in other browsers, how do I do that?
Answer: You can execute your Selenese test in another browser by specifying the “htmlSuite” followed by the path of your
Selenese suite while starting the Selenium Server. Selenium Server would be covered in detail in question
about Selenium RC.

I have added one command in the middle of the list of commands, how do I test only this new command?
Answer: You can double click on the newly added command, and Selenium IDE would execute only that command in
browser.

Can I make Selenium IDE tests begin test execution from a certain command and not from the very first command?
Answer: You could set a command as a “start” command from the context menu. When a command is set as a start command, then a small green symbol appears before the command. The same context menu can be used to toggle this option

Are there other tools available outside Selenium IDE to help me tests my element locators
Answer:  You could XPath checker https://addons.mozilla.org/enUS/firefox/addon/xpathchecker/ to test your XPath
locators and Firefinder (a Firebug add-on) to test you, CSS locators. Firefinder can also be used to test XPath locators.

What is an upcoming advancement in Selenium IDE?
Answer: The latest advancement in Selenium IDE would be to have capabilities of converting Selenium IDE tests in
Webdriver (Selenium 2.0) options. This would help to generate quick and dirty tests for Selenium 2.0

How can I use the looping option (flow control) is Selenium IDE
Answer: Selenese does not provide support for looping, but there is an extension that could be used to achieve the same.

Can I use a screen coordinate while using the click command? I want to click on a specific part of my element.
Answer: You would need to use the clickAT command to achieve. the clickAt command accepts element locator and x, y
coordinates as arguments – clickAt(locator, coordString)

How do I verify the presence of drop-down options using Selenium?
Answer: Use assertSelectOptions as following to check options in a drop-down list.

Can I get data from a specific HTML table cell using Selenium IDE?
Answer: Use the storeTable command to get data from a specific cell in an HTML table, following example store text from cell 0,4 from an HTML table
storeTable
css=#tableId.0.4
textFromCell

I want to make a Selenium IDE record and display CSS locator followed by other locators, is it possible to give high priority to CSS locator in Selenium IDE?
Answer: You can change the default behavior of Selenium IDE > element locator preference by creating a js file with the following– LocatorBuilders.order = [‘css: name’, ‘CSS: id’, ‘id’, ‘link’, ‘name’, ‘XPath: attributes’]; And add this file under “Selenium IDE Extension” under Selenium Options.

My application has dynamic alerts which don’t always appear, how do I handle them?
Answer: If you want to simulate clicking “ok “ on alert than use – chooseOkOnNextConfirmation and if you want to simulate clicking “cancel” on the alert then use Selenium RC (Selenium 1.0) Questions

Can I right-click on a locator?
Answer: You can use command contextMenu ( locator) to simulate a right-click on an element on a web page.

How do I capture a screenshot of a page using Selenium IDE?
Answer: Use the command – captureEntirePageScreenshot to take the screenshot of the page.

I want to pause my test execution after a certain command.
Answer: Use pause command which takes time in milliseconds and would pause test execution for a specified time –
pause ( waitTime )

I used the open command to launch my page, but I encountered a timeout error?
Answer: This happens because open commands wait for only 30 seconds for the page to load. If your application takes
more than 30 sec, then you can use “setTimeout ( timeout )” to make selenium IDE wait for a specified time before proceeding with test execution.

What’s the difference between type and typeKeys commands?
Answer: type command simulates enter operations at one go while typeKeys simulates keystroke key by key.
typeKeys could use when typing data in the text box, which brings options (like Google suggestion list) because
such an operation is not usually simulated using type command.

130 Selenium Interview Question
Difference Between Assertion and Verification?
Answer: Verify command will not stop the execution of the test case if verification fails. It will log an error and proceed with the execution of the rest of the test case. We use verify commands in Selenium IDE when we still want to proceed with the execution of the test case even if the expected output is not matched for a test step.

Assert command will stop the execution of the test case if verification fails. It will log an error and will not proceed with the execution of the rest of the test case. We use assertions in scenarios where there is no point proceeding further if the expected output is not matched.

It’s pretty simple. Use assertions when you want to stop the execution of a test case if the expected output is not matched and use verification when you still want to proceed execution of a test case if the expected output is not matched.

The difference between Set, List, and Map?
Set (Interface)

Set is an unordered collection that doesn’t allow duplicate (no duplicate) elements
We can iterate the values by calling the iterator() method
Set s = new HashSet();
Iterator iter = s.iterator();
List (Interface)

The list is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements
We can iterate the values by calling the iterator() method
List li = new ArrayList();
Iterator iter = li.iterator();
Map (Interface)

In Map, we used to store the data in key and value pairs, we may have duplicate values but no duplicate keys
In Map we don’t have iterator() method, but we can get the keys by calling the method keySet()
Map m; // insert values
Set s = m.keySet();
// Get Map keys into the Set and then iterate this Set object normally
// m.keySet() returns Set object with Map keys
Iterator iter = s.iterator();
How to Create a Parameterized Test in JUnit Testing Framework?
Answer: In this example, we are going to see how to create a parameterized test in the JUnit testing framework.

Create the Java class to be tested
Answer: Create a folder named JUnitParameterized. This is the folder where your classes will be located. Using a text editor, create a Java class named Addition.java. To make sure your file name is Addition.java, (not Addition.java.txt), first choose “Save as > Save as type > All files,” then type in the file name Addition.java.

Addition.java

public class Addition 
{ 
public int addNumbers(int a, int b)
{
 int sum = a + b; 
 return sum; 
 }
}
2. Create a JUnit test case
In the same directory (JUnitParameterized), use a text editor and create a java class named JunitAdditionTest.java with the following code.

What are the types of Assertions in JUnit?
Answer: Assertions:

JUnit provides overloaded assertion methods for all primitive types and Objects and arrays (of primitives or Objects). The parameter order is the expected value, followed by an actual value. Optionally the first parameter can be a String message that is output on failure. There is a slightly different assertion, assertThat that has parameters of the optional failure message, the actual value, and a Matcher object. Note that expected and actual are reversed compared to the other assert methods.

Examples: A representative of each assert method is shown below.

import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.allOf;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.anyOf;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.equalTo;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.not;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.sameInstance;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.startsWith;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertThat;
import static org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers.both;
import static org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers.containsString;
import static org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers.everyItem;
import static org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers.hasItems;
import java.util.Arrays;
import org.hamcrest.core.CombinableMatcher;
import org.junit.Test;

What is New in TestNG? and Difference Between TestNG and JUNIT?
Answer: TestNG is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

Annotations.
Flexible test configuration.
Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
Support for parameters.
Allows distribution of tests on slave machines.
Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
It is supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc…).
Dependent methods for application server testing.
If you want to learn TestNG, you can download it and see its documentation at “http://testng.org/doc/index.html.” TestNG is extensively used in Selenium Automation and Code testing instead of Junit due to its advantages over it. Using TestNG Selenium automation becomes simplified, and also the Parallel execution using Selenium Grid becomes easy.

Thanks For Reading, and I hope this post will help you get some idea about the challenges during automating a project by using Selenium Webdriver. For More Interview Programs and Questions Visit Our Blog.

So here we go with the top challenges:

1) Testing the complete application: Is it possible? I think impossible. There are millions of test combinations. It’s not possible to test each and every combination both in the manual as well as in automation testing. If you try all these combinations, you will never ship the product

2) Misunderstanding of company processes: Sometimes, you don’t pay proper attention to what the company-defined processes are, and these are for what purposes. There are some myths in testers that they should only go with company processes; even these processes do not apply to their current testing scenario. This results in incomplete and inappropriate application testing.

3) Relationship with developers: Big challenge. Requires a very skilled tester to handle this relation positively and even by completing the work in testers way. There are simply hundreds of excuses developers or testers can make when they do not agree with some points. For this, tester also requires good communication, troubleshooting, and analyzing skills.

4) Regression testing: When a project goes on, expanding, the regression testing work becomes uncontrolled. The pressure to handle the current functionality changes, previous working functionality checks, and bug tracking.

5) Lack of skilled testers: I will call this ‘wrong management decision’ while selecting or training testers for their project task at hand. These unskilled fellows may add more chaos than simplifying the testing work. This results in incomplete, insufficient, and ad-hoc testing throughout the testing life cycle.

6) Testing always under time constraint: Hey tester, we want to ship this product by this weekend, are you ready for completion? When this order comes from the boss, the tester focuses on task completion and not on the test coverage and quality of work. There is a huge list of tasks that you need to complete within a specified time. This includes writing, executing, automating, and reviewing the test cases.

7) Which tests to execute first? If you are facing the challenge stated in point no 6, then how will you make a decision in which test cases should be executed and with what priority? Which tests are important over others? This requires a good experience to work under pressure.

8 ) Understanding the requirements: Sometimes, testers are responsible for communicating with customers to understand the requirements. What if the tester fails to understand the requirements? Will he be able to test the application properly? Definitely No! Testers require good listening and understanding capabilities.

9) Automation testing: Many sub-challenges – Should automate the testing work? Till what level automation should be done? Do you have sufficient and skilled resources for automation? Is time permissible for automating the test cases? The decision of automation or manual testing will need to address the pros and cons of each process.

10) The decision to stop the testing: When to stop testing? Tough decision. Requires core judgment of testing processes and the importance of each process. It also requires ‘on the fly’ decision ability.

11) One test team under multiple projects: Challenging to keep track of each task. Communication challenges. Many times fails one or both the projects.

12) Reuse of Test scripts: Application development methods are changing rapidly, making it difficult to manage the test tools and test scripts. Test script migration or reuse is an essential but difficult task.

13) Testers focusing on finding easy bugs: If the organization is rewarding testers based on a number of bugs (very bad approach to judge testers performance), then some testers only concentrate on finding easy bugs that don’t require deep understanding and testing. A hard or subtle bug remains unnoticed in such a testing approach.

14) To cope with attrition: Increasing salaries and benefits, making many employees leave the company at very short career intervals. Management is facing hard problems to cope with the attrition rate. Challenges – New testers require project training from the beginning, complex projects are difficult to understand, delay in shipping date!

These are some top software testing challenges we face daily. Project success or failure depends largely on how you address these basic issues.

Q: How to reverse string ?

public class ReverseString {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
 
        String myStr = "Guru99";
 
 
        //create Method and pass and input parameter string 
        String reversed = reverseString(myStr);
        System.out.println("The reversed string is: " + reversed);
        
    }
 
 
    //Method take string parameter and check string is empty or not
    public static String reverseString(String myStr)
    {
        if (myStr.isEmpty()){
         System.out.println("String in now Empty");    
         return myStr;
        }
        //Calling Function Recursively
        System.out.println("String to be passed in Recursive Function: "+myStr.substring(1));
        return reverseString(myStr.substring(1)) + myStr.charAt(0);
    }

==================================================================================================================================================================



Ques.4. What is Quality Assurance?
Ans. Quality assurance is a process driven approach which checks if the process of developing the product is correct and conforming to all the standards. It is considered as a preventive measure as it identifies the weakness in the process to build a software. It involves activites like document review, test cases review, walkthroughs, inspection etc.---Verification

Ques.5. What is Quality Control?
Ans. Quality control is product driven approach which checks that the developed product conforms to all the specified requirements. It is considered as a corrective measure as it tests the built product to find the defects. It involves different types of testing includes actual execution  like functional testing, performance testing, usability testing etc.---validation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What are the tools of performance testing?
JMETER
LoadRunner(HP
QAload(Compuware):
Silk Performe
WebLoad(RadView)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is exception test in Selenium?

An exception test is an exception that you expect will be thrown inside a test class. If you have written a test case in such way that it should throw an exception, then you can use the @Test annotation and specify which exception you will be expecting by mentioning it in the parameters. Take a look at the example below: @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class)
--Do note the syntax, where the exception is suffixed with .class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of Break and Continue ::::=====>

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if (i == 3)
{
break;
}
System.out.println(i);
}


Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q #38) What is a Thread?
IKn Java, the flow of a execution is called Thread. Every java program has at least one thread called main thread, the Main thread is created by JVM. 

public static void main(String[] args)
{//main thread starts here
    }
****Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.
----------------------------------------------------
99. What is Test Metrics?
Software test metrics is to monitor and control process and product. It helps to drive the project towards our planned goals without deviation.
----------------------------------------------------
24) When we choose Informal Testing?
 Whenever we don’t have proper documentation (Requirements etc…) and not have sufficient Time then we choose Informal Testing. Using Experienced based Techniques (Ex: Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing etc…) we conduct Testing.
----------------------------------------------------
100. What is desired capabilities?
In Selenium we use desired capabilities to handle SSL certificates in chrome browser
We need to create an instance of DesiredCapabilities
DesiredCapabilities desiredCapability = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
desired capabilities are used for chrome , for firefox we use firefox options 
----------------------------------------------------
1. What is the difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)? 
Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the process used to make Software Application. So the defects don’t arise when the Software Application is being developed. Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the defects in the Software Application
----------------------------------------------------

2. What is the difference between Preventative and Reactive approaches in testing? 
Preventive approach: It is also known as Verification Process. This approach is to prevent defects. In this approach, tests are designed at early stages of SDLC i.e., before the software has been produced. Here in this approach testers try to prevent defects in the early stages. It comes under Quality Analysis (QA). 

Reactive approach: It is also known as Validation Process. This approach is to identify defects. In this approach, tests are designed to execute after the software has been produced. Here we try to find defects. It comes under Quality Control (QC).
----------------------------------------------------
10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include?
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base
----------------------------------------------------
19. What is the difference between build and release?
 Build: A build is a version of a software. Every build has a number for identification purpose. Build is a pre-release version of a Release. Build is given to testing team by developers to test the application locally. Build numbers are incremental. Release: A release is the distribution of the final version of an application to the customer by software development team. 
----------------------------------------------------
9. What is usecase? 
A. Usecase explains the step by step procedure of how a particular functionality of s/w is used by the end user.usecase contains sections such as . 
usecase id . 
usecase name . 
decription . 
flow of events . 
alternative flow of events . 
pre,post conditions
----------------------------------------------------
10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include?
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base

----------------------------------------------------
23. What is MR and ER? 
MR: MR stands for Modification Request. It is used to change the existing functionality in a software, it is usually requested by clients. ER: ER stands for Enhancement report. It is used to add a new feature in a software. It is usually requested by clients
----------------------------------------------------
11. What are the different sections present in SRS? 
A. overview
 Scope 
Features 
User characteristics 
Software requirements
 Hardware requirements
 Performance requirements 
Use cases Security and
 reliability requirements

----------------------------------------------------
15. What are the different models generally followed in documenting requirements?
 A. Two models are followed in documenting the requirements which are usecase model and paragraph model. in paragraph model business requirements are written like a paragraph which is old model. Now a days almost all companies follow the usecase model where the requirements are written by stating thier clear objectives and explained with the help of screen shots.
----------------------------------------------------
22. Explain the review process you follow in your organization? 
A. The various phases of the review process followed in my organization are: 
Planning: >selecting the personal for review >allocating roles >defining entry and exit criteria. 
Kick-off: >Distributing documents >explaining the objectives >checking entry criteria, etc.
Individual preparation: > in the phase, each of the participants will work before the review meeting and be ready with questions and comments. 
Review Meeting: > Discussion among the review members by going through each line of the work product. > Logging comments > Making decision about the defect.
Rework: > Fixing defects found during the review, typically done by the author. 
Follow-up: > checking the defects that have been addressed. >gathering metrics and checking the exit criteria.
----------------------------------------------------
23. What are the roles present in the review? 

==Manager: >decides on execution of reviews. > allocates time in project schedules. > determines if the review objectives have met.
==Moderator: >leads the review, including planning and running the meeting >follows-up after the meeting. 
==Author: The author is the person who has created the item to be reviewed. the author may also be asked questions within the review. 
==Reviewer: The reviewer are the attendees of the review who attempt to find errors in the item under review. they should come from different perspectives in order to provide a well balanced review of the item.
==scribe: The scribe or recorder is the person who is responsible for documenting issues raised during the process of the review meeting
----------------------------------------------------
29. Explain what do you document during the review process? 
A. we document page and line number of defect, origin of defect, severity of defect. We also document other information like work product ID, reviewers, etc
----------------------------------------------------
63. What is an entry criterion for test closure? 
A. Decision to stop testing 
----------------------------------------------------
64. Who takes this decision? 
A. The Test Manager
----------------------------------------------------
96) Mention what is desired capability? How is it useful in terms of Selenium?
The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
desired capabalities are for chrome and for furefox we use firfoxoptions  
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.88. How can we pass parameter to test script using testNG?
Ans. Using @Parameter annotation and 'parameter' tag in testng.xml we can pass parameters to the test script
Sample testng.xml -

<suite name="sampleTestSuite">
   <test name="sampleTest">   
      <parameter name="sampleParamName" value="sampleParamValue"/>
      <classes>
         <class name="TestFile" />
      </classes>      
   </test>
</suite>


Sample test script-

public class TestFile {
   @Test
   @Parameters("sampleParamName")
   public void parameterTest(String paramValue) {
webElement userName = driver.findElement(****).sendkeys("paramValue");
      System.out.println("Value of sampleParamName is - " + sampleParamName);
   }

----------------------------------------------------
What are some commonly encountered exceptions in selenium?
    NoSuchElementException - When no element could be located from the locator provided.
    ElementNotVisibleException - When element is present in the dom but is not visible.
    NoAlertPresentException - When we try to switch to an alert but the targetted alert is not present.
    NoSuchFrameException - When we try to switch to a frame but the targetted frame is not present.
    NoSuchWindowException - When we try to switch to a window but the targetted window is not present.
    UnexpectedAlertPresentException - When an unexpected alert blocks normal interaction of the driver.
    TimeoutException - When a command execution gets timeout.
    InvalidElementStateException - When the state of an element is not appropriate for the desired action.
    NoSuchAttributeException - When we are trying to fetch an attribute's value but the attribute is not correct
    WebDriverException - When there is some issue with driver instance preventing it from getting launched.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.4. What is Quality Assurance?

It is considered as a preventive measure as it identifies the weakness in the process to build a software. It involves activites like document review, test cases review, walkthroughs, inspection etc.---Verification

Ques.5. What is Quality Control?
Ans. Quality control is product driven approach which checks that the developed product conforms to all the specified requirements. It is considered as a corrective measure as it tests the built product to find the defects. It involves different types of testing includes actual execution  like functional testing, performance testing, usability testing etc.---validation
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.20. What is defect density?
Ans. Defect density is the measure of density of the defects in the system. It can be calculated by dividing number of defect identified by the total number of line of code(or methods or classes) in the application or program.

----------------------------------------------------
Low priority-Low severity - A spelling mistake in a page not frequently navigated by users.or page taking time to refresh
Low priority-High severity- Application crashing in some very corner case.
High priority-Low severity - Slight change in logo color or spelling mistake in company name.
High priority-High severity - Issue with login functionality.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.25. What is a critical bug?
Ans. A critical bug is a bug that impacts a major functionality of the application and the application cannot be delivered without fixing the bug. It is different from blocker bug /  show stopper as it doesn't affect or blocks the testing of other part of the application.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.59. What is usability testing?
Ans. Usability testing is the type of testing that aims at determining the ease of using the application. It aims at uncovering the usability defects in the application.
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.60. What is Accessibility testing?
Ans. Accessibility is the type of testing which aims at determining the ease of use or operation of the application specifically for people with disabilities.
persons like deaf , blind
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.70. What is concurrency testing?
Ans. Concurrency testing is a multi-user testing in which an application is evaluated by analyzing application's behaviour with concurent users acccessing the same functionality.Locking and delocking is checked .Example : file at shared point 
----------------------------------------------------
Ques.73. What is fuzz testing?
Ans. Fuzz testing is a type of testing in which large amount of random data is provided as input to the application in order to find security loopholes and other issues in the application.
----------------------------------------------------

Robot API is used for handling Keyboard or mouse events. It is generally used to upload files to the server in selenium automation. 
Robot robot = new Robot();
----------------------------------------------------
2. Name some popular tools for automation testing.
Selenium,QTP AND HP UFT ,Appium for mobile testing 


12. How can you use Selenium to identify an object?
You can use isElementPresent (String locator) to find an object using Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and if found, returns a Boolean

Q::Name the three types of Selenese
Actions: Used for performing the interactions and operations with the target elements
Assertions: Used as a check point
Accessors: Used for storing the values in a variable



====================================================Latest 01-May===========================
Q:******Ways to define string in java ?

There are two ways to create a String object:
By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”. For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);

===============================================================================
1. What's the fastest locator in Selenium?

Id is fastest and then comes name
===============================================================================
2. What does ::(double colon) in sibling xpaths represent?
A double colon :: is used to separate the axis specifier from the node test.
===============================================================================
4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================
What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? 
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.
===============================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?
Since an array is static in nature i.e. you cannot change the size of an array once created, So, if you need an array which can resize itself then you should use the ArrayList.
===============================================================================
Q>What did you keep in excel and .properties? (Amazon, CG)
Ans :- In Excel we keep all the data, such as multiple combination of user names and password.
In properties file we keep xpaths, URL, default user name and password etc.
===============================================================================
Q: WHat is thread in testNG.XML file in case of parallel testing ?

Threads in parallel testing refer to different parts in which the test execution will be divided and run parallelly

So if there are two threads and two methods, they will take one method each and run them parallelly (if we are running the methods parallelly). But if there are three methods and two threads, one will have to wait until one thread is free and takes up that method for execution. Therefore, we need to specify the number of threads we want to run while performing parallel testing in TestNG.


<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name = "Parallel Testing Suite">
   <test name = "Parallel Tests" parallel = "methods" thread-count = "2">--------------------------------Es ki baat ho rhi hai 
      <classes>
         <class name = "ParallelTest" />
      </classes>
   </test>
</suite>


Note - example let us suppose there are 3 methods and you defined thread as 2 .then 2 parallel chalenge , aur jab ek thread free hogi tab woh 3rd method ke liye chalega .In this case 2 methods ka same thread id hoga aur 3rd ka alag ...
===============================================================================
As I mentioned, if we run the test methods directly through the test case file (Run As -> TestNG Test) rather than the XML file, they will run serially. Run the file in the same way (serially) and notice the time taken for overall execution.

17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

21.negative testcase for a pen?
Put the pen in water and then try to write. Verify if you are able to write with this pen. The pen can get wet because of the water spill on the table or during the rainy season. It can be due to any reason.
Drop the pen from some height (Table height) in the upside-down position. Verify if you are able to write with this pen. By mistake, the pen can any time fall on the ground. So testing this possibility to know its impact, will help us in knowing the quality of the pen
===============================================================================
Q: Convert Array to string 

public class ArrayOfStrings {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      String stringArray[] = {"Hello ", " how", " are", " you", " welcome", " to", " Tutorialspoint"};
      StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
      for(int i = 0; i < stringArray.length; i++) {
         sb.append(stringArray[i]);
      }
      String str = sb.toString();
      System.out.println(str);
   }
}

===============================================================================
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

8) If try With Multiple catch Block Present, Is Order of catch Blocks Important in 
Which Order We Have To Take?

Yes , jaise aapke codd mein pehle arthmetic error aani hai to pehle uske respective catch block hona chaiye ..
agli exception say IO error h , then uske respective block hona chaiye 
===============================================================================
10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--
===============================================================================
11)Is it Possible To Take try, catch Inside try Block?
No , In Java, we can use a try block within a try block. Each time a try statement is entered, the context of that exception is pushed on to a stack

===============================================================================
16)In Which Situation Finally Block Will Not Executed?
Ans - if try block will have a statement System.exit();
===============================================================================
17)If Return Statement Present Inside try, is Finally Block Will Be Executed?
Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed.
===============================================================================
19)Is it Possible To Write Any Statement Between try-catch And finally?
No, we cannot write any statements in between try, catch and finally blocks and these blocks form one unit
===============================================================================
20)Is it Possible To Take 2 finally Blocks For The Same try?
You can only have one finally clause per try/catch/finally statement
===============================================================================
29)Is it Possible To Use throws Keyword For Any Java Class?
No ,It is used in method definition, to declare that a risky method is being called.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================

Selenium should be able to handle Android browser. There is a Selenium Android Driver for running tests in the Android browser.


Q:Compare Software Testing Vs. Debugging.
Testing - Done by Testing team , No need of design knowledge
Debugging - finding discripensy in code , perfomred by dev , need to have  full design knowledge


10. Highlight the role of QA in project development.

    Reduce the defects and errors
    Preventing defects from occurring
    Maintain the system quality as per the specifications
    Test the projects on failure parameters to check its fault tolerance


11. What are the tools of performance testing?
JMETER
LoadRunner(HP
QAload(Compuware):
Silk Performe
WebLoad(RadView)


8. What is Page Factory?
Page Factory gives an optimized way to implement Page Object Model. When we say it is optimized, it refers to the fact that the memory utilization is very good and also the implementation is done in an object oriented manner. 

The concept of separating the Page Object Repository and Test Methods is followed here also. Instead of having to use ‘FindElements’, we use annotations like: @FindBy ,@FindBy can accept tagName, partialLinkText, name, linkText, id, css, className & xpath as attributes.



12. How to scroll down a page using JavaScript in Selenium?
using javaScript-jsexecutor


15. What are different types of frameworks? 
Data Driven Framework:-
When the entire test data is generated from some external files like Excel, CSV, XML or some database table, then it is called Data Driven framework.

Keyword Driven Framework:-
When only the instructions and operations are written in a different file like an Excel worksheet, it is called Keyword Driven framework.

Hybrid Framework:-
A combination of both the Data Driven framework and the Keyword Driven framework is called Hybrid framework.


16. Which files can be used as data source for different frameworks?
Some of the file types of the dataset can be: excel, xml, text, csv, feature file etc.


20. How to set the size of browser window using Selenium?
driver.manage().window().setSize(d);


22. How to switch to a new window (new tab) which opens up after you click on a link?
String handle= driver.getWindowHandle();
for (String handle : driver.getWindowHandles()) 
{
driver.switchTo().window(handle);
}


23. How do you upload a file using Selenium WebDriver?
To upload a file we can simply use the command element.send_keys(file path). But there is a prerequisite before we upload the file. We have to use the html tag: ‘input’ and attribute type should be ‘file’.
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")


27. Which technique should you consider using throughout the script “if there is neither frame id nor frame name”?
If neither frame name nor frame id is available, then we can use frame by index.
Let’s say, that there are 3 frames in a web page and if none of them have frame name and frame id, then we can still select those frames by using frame (zero-based) index attribute. Each frame will have an index number. The first frame would be at index “0”, the second at index “1” and the third at index “2”. Once the frame has been selected, all subsequent calls on the WebDriver interface will be made to that frame.

driver.switchTo().frame(int arg0);


28. What is the significance of testng.xml?
I’m pretty sure you all know the importance of TestNG. Since Selenium does not support report generation and test case management, we use TestNG framework with Selenium. TestNG is much more advanced than JUnit, and it makes implementing annotations easy. That is the reason TestNG framewrok is used with Selenium WebDriver.

It is by taking instructions from the testng.xml file. We cannot define a test suite in testing source code, instead it is represented in an XML file, because suite is the feature of execution. The test suite, that I am talking about is basically a collection of test cases. 



30. Explain DataProviders in TestNG using an example. Can I call a single data provider method for multiple functions and classes?
@DataProvider marks a method as supplying data for a test method. The annotated method must return an Object[] where each Object[] can be assigned to parameter list of the test method.
To use the DataProvider feature in your tests, you have to declare a method annotated by @DataProvider and then use the said method in the test method using the ‘dataProvider‘ attribute in the Test annotation.
As far as the second part of the question is concerned, Yes, the same DataProvider can be used in multiple functions and classes by declaring DataProvider in separate class and then reusing it in multiple classes.



31. How to skip a method or a code block in TestNG?
@Test(enabled = false)


32. What is soft assertion in Selenium? How can you mark a test case as failed by using soft assertion?
Soft Assertions are customized error handlers provided by TestNG. Soft Assertions do not throw exceptions when assertion fails, and they simply continue to the next test step. They are commonly used when we want to perform multiple assertions.

To mark a test as failed with soft assertions, call assertAll() method at the end of the test.


1) What is Cucumber and what are the advantages of Cucumber?

What is desired capabilities?
Desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
desired capabalities are for chrome and for furefox we use firfoxoption
desired capabilities are used for chrome , for firefox we use firefox options 


DesiredCapabilities dcap = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
dcap.setBrowserName("firefox");
dcap.setPlatform(Platform.WIN10_1);
driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(nodeUrl),dcap);

13 What is constructor overloading?
Answer : Same as method overloading, Single class can have multiple constructors with same name as class name but all have different signatures (different input parameters and types) is called constructor overloading. 


14 : Can we override static methods?
 No.. We can not override static methods as they are part of  class not object.. You can override static methods but output will be different than the expected.



15 : How to reverse string in java?
public static void main(String[] args) {
StringBuffer abc = new StringBuffer("I like java very much.");---------yaha aapkpo String na le kar Straing Buffer lena hai 
 System.out.println(abc.reverse());
}

String input = "Nipun Verma";
 
char charArray[] = input.tocharArray();

for(int i = charArray.length-1;i>=0;i--){
system.out.PrintLn(charArray[i]);



16 : Can we overload static methods? 
Ans:yes , both static as well as non static 



18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .



20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.


21 : Explain System.out.println();
--System : is a final class in  java.lang package.
--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.


 33 : Which is super class of all other classes in java?
Answer : java.lang.Object is  super class of all other classes in java.


36 : What is the difference between the Constructor and Method?
Constructor :

    Name of the constructor must be same as class name.
    Constructor must not have any return type.
    It is used to initialize the state of an object with new keyword
    It is not possible to call constructor directly. Constructors called implicitly when the new keyword 


Method :

    Method name can be any.
    Method must have return type.
    It is used to expose behavior of an object.
    Methods can be called directly.


40. What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?

    “this” keyword is used to store current object reference while “super” keyword is used to store super class object in sub class..
    “this” is used to access methods of the current class while “super” is used to access methods of the base class.
    this() used to call constructors in the same class whereas super() is used to call super class constructor, used to call cons of parent class like BadePapa called by papa and Papa called by Nipun.


 43 : Can we declare class as protected?
Answer : No, You can not declare class as protected.


48 : What is a package?
Answer : A package is a namespace which allows developer to organizes a group of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually it is just like folder which contains different types of files. It is easy to keep things organised by keeping related classes and interfaces into packages.


9 : What is string in java?
Answer : In Java programming, String is object which is prepared by sequence of characters.java.lang package has String class to create and manipulate strings. Read more on string in java.
characters always defined in quotes 


2. How can you use Selenium to identify an object?
You can use isElementPresent 
(String locator) to find an object using Selenium. It takes a locator as the argument and if found, returns a Boolean. 


6) Explain what is assertion in Selenium and what are the types of assertion?
Assertion is used as a  verification point. It verifies that the state of the application conforms to what is expected.  The types of assertion are “assert” , “verify” and “waifFor”. 


11) What is the difference between verify and assert commands?
Assert:  Assert allows to check whether an element is on the page or not. The test will stop on the step failed, if the asserted element is not available. In other words, the test will terminated at the point where check fails.

Verify: Verify command will check whether the element is on the page, if it is not then the test will carry on executing.  In verification, all the commands are going to run guaranteed even if any of test fails. 


19) What is heightened privileges browsers?
The purpose of heightened privileges is similar to Proxy Injection, allows websites to do something that are not commonly permitted.  The key difference is that the browsers are launced in a special mode called heightened privileges.  By using these browser mode, Selenium core can open the AUT directly and also read/write its content without passing the whole AUT through the Selenium RC server. 


49)   Explain how you can use recovery scenario with Selenium?
Recovery scenarios depends upon the programming language you use.  If you are using Java then you can use exception handling to overcome same.  By using “Try Catch Block” within your Selenium WebDriver Java tests

Exceptional handling is not present
Selenium IDE uses only HTML languages
External databases reading is not possible with IDE
Reading from the external files like .txt, .xls is not possible
Conditional or branching statements execution like if,else,  select statements is not possible


W0)  How you can convert any Selenium IDE tests from Selenese to another language?
You can use the format option of Selenium IDE to convert tests into another programming language


65)  In which format does source view shows your script in Selenium IDE ?
In Selenium IDE source view shows your script in XML format 



Q2. Explain public static void main(String args[]).
    public : Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.
    static : It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class based i.e it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.
    void : It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.
    main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.
    String args[] : It is the parameter passed to the main method.


Q3. Why Java is platform independent?
Platform independent practically means “write once run anywhere”. Java is called so because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.


Q4. Why java is not 100% Object-oriented?
Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive datatypes such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.


Q5. What are wrapper classes?
Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects)and vice versa .Autoboxing & Boxing


Q6. What are constructors in Java?
In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.
    --Default constructor
  --  Parameterized constructor


Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?
Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between String and string in C#.
Donno same hai no differnce , it is matter of your choice what to use , String or string .Mand devs use String ,however other use String .

Example ::
string str1= "Hello";
String str2 = "World!";
            
Console.WriteLine(str1.GetType().FullName); // System.String
Console.WriteLine(str2.GetType().FullName); // System.String

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?
Abstract :
=class can have abstract as well as normal methods , while Interface has only abstract methods .
=An abstract class can have non-abstract methods while All methods of an Interface are abstract.
=An abstract class can contain constructors while An Interface cannot contain constructors
==An abstract class can have instance variables. while An Interface cannot have instance variables
==An abstract class can have any visibility: public, private, protected. while An Interface visibility must be public (or) none

**An interface can extends another interface or interfaces (more than one interface) .
A class that implements interface must implements all the methods in interface.



Q:
Method Overriding:  
    In Method Overriding, sub class have the same method with same name and exactly the same number and type of parameters and same return type as a super class.
    Method Overriding is to “Change” existing behavior of method.
    It is a run time polymorphism.
    The methods must have same signature.
    It always requires inheritance in Method Overriding.


Method Overloading :polymorphism 
    In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.
    Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to method’s behavior.
    It is a compile time polymorphism.
    The methods must have different signature.
    It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.`


Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there. 



Q6. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
If a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.
Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred as Diamond Problem.



Q:How can we move to parent of an element using XPath?

64. What is Robot API?
Robot API is used for handling Keyboard or mouse events. It is generally used to upload files to the server in selenium automation


78. What is a hybrid framework?
A hybrid framework is a combination of one or more frameworks. Normally it is associated with combination of data driven and keyword driven frameworks where both the test data and test actions are kept in external files(in the form of table).


79. What is selenium Grid?
Selenium grid is a tool that helps in distributed running of test scripts across different machines having different browsers, browser version, platforms etc in parallel. In selenium grid there is hub that is a central server managing all the distributed machines known as nodes.

80. What are some advantages of selenium grid?
The advantages of selenium grid are-
It allows running test cases in parallel thereby saving test execution time.
Multi browser testing is possible using selenium grid by running the test on machines having different browsers.
It is allows multi-platform testing by configuring nodes having different operating systems.


81. What is a hub in selenium grid?
A hub is server or a central point in selenium grid that controls the test executions on the different machines.


82. What is a node in selenium grid?
Nodes are the machines which are attached to the selenium grid hub and have selenium instances running the test scripts. Unlike hub there can be multiple nodes in selenium grid.



84 What is the purpose of creating a reference variable- ‘driver’ of type WebDriver instead of directly creating a FireFoxDriver object or any other driver’s reference in the statement Webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();?
By creating a reference variable of type WebDriver we can use the same variable to work with multiple browsers like ChromeDriver, IEDriver etc.



94. How can we set priority of test cases in TestNG?
Using priority parameter in @Test annotation in TestNG we can define priority of test cases. The default priority of test when not specified is integer value 0. Example-
@Test(priority=1)




1 : What is object in java?
--Object Is an Instance of class and it has its own state and behavior. In real world we can say, Dog is object of Animal class which have different state like breed, color, name, hungry, etc and behavior  like wagging tail, fetching, barking etc.


2 : What is class?
A class is the blueprint or we can say template from which individual objects are created.


3 : What is constructor?
Constructor is a code block just like a method which is used to initialize the state of an object. It will be invoked at the time of object creation to construct the value for object.


32 : Java support constructor inheritance?
Answer : No, Constructor inheritance is not supported in java. View more details on constructor in java.


34 : What is Encapsulation?
Answer : Encapsulation is process of packing code and data together In to a single Unit. View more details on Encapsulation in java.


42 : Can We Overload main method in java?
Answer : Yes, Java class can have any number of main methods so it is possible to overload main method. But when you run program, It will not execute overloaded main method. Always It will execute only public static void main(String[] args) method.Run time error milega

46 : What is Polymorphism?
Answer : Polymorphism is ability using which we can create reference variables or methods which behaves differently in different programmatic context. Best example of polymorphism is human. We behaves differently with different people in different environment. Our behavior will be different when we meet to boss and meet to friend. Read more on Polymorphism in java.

74. What is a Defect?

The variation between the actual results and expected results is known as a defect. If a developer finds an issue and corrects it by himself in the development phase then it’s called a defect. 

75. What is a Bug?

If testers find any mismatch in the application/system in testing phase then they call it as Bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76. What is an Error?

We can’t compile or run a program due to a coding mistake in a program. If a developer unable to successfully compile or run a program then they call it as an error. 

77. What is a Failure?

Once the product is deployed and customers find any issues then they call the product as a failure product. After release, if an end user finds an issue then that particular issue is called as a failure. Click here for more details.


6) Did you face any problems during defect reporting and tracking? 
Yes, Developers rejected 2 or 3 valid defects. 


9) Did you perform any Live testing? 
Yes, In my current project we used live data for some test cases. 


10) What is difference between Front End Testing and Back End testing?

1. What is the difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)? 
Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the process used to make Software Application. So the defects don’t arise when the Software Application is being developed. 
Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the defects in the Software Application



2. What is the difference between Preventative and Reactive approaches in testing? 
Preventive approach: It is also known as Verification Process. This approach is to prevent defects. In this approach, tests are designed at early stages of SDLC i.e., before the software has been produced. Here in this approach testers try to prevent defects in the early stages. It comes under Quality Analysis (QA). 
Reactive approach: It is also known as Validation Process. 
This approach is to identify defects. In this approach, tests are designed to execute after the software has been produced. Here we try to find defects. It comes under Quality Control (QC).



5. Explain the process of QA testing? 
In simple words, QA testing process is a step by step process which involves analyzing requirement documents, preparing test strategy, test plan and test cases, executing test cases when the build is ready. In the execution process QA’s perform different types of testing to make sure the software reaches or exceeds the expectation. 



6. What is the role of documentation in QA? 
Documentation plays a vital role in Quality Assurance. All the documents involved in SDLC such as Business Requirement Specifications, Designs, Inspection reports, Configurations, Code changes, Test Strategy, Test plans, Test cases, Bug reports, User manuals should be documented. 
• Documentation helps us to achieve high quality software product. 
• Documentation is necessary to make things more real 
• We could use documentation as a reference material and reuse it when necessary
• We could save lot of organization’s time, effort and money by maintaining proper documentation.
• Proper documentation makes easy for the client to review the software process.


10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include? 
Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. 
It is a document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base



13. What is a Test case template? 
A test case template is a document comes under one of the test artifacts, which allows testers to develop the test cases for a particular test scenario in order to verify whether the features of an application are working as intended or not. Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario which has a set of pre-conditions, test data, expected result, post-conditions and actual results. Most of the companies are using test case management tools such as Quality Center (HP QC), JIRA etc.TDP and Rally, and some of the companies still using excel sheets to write test cases



14. What are the key components of a test case template .
The key components of a test case template are Project name, Module name, Created by, Date of creation, reviewed by, date of review, executed by, Date of execution, test scenario, tase case id, test case description, Precondition, Test steps, Test data, expected result, post condition, actual result, status of the bug. 



19. What is the difference between build and release? 
Build: A build is a version of a software. Every build has a number for identification purpose. Build is a pre-release version of a Release. Build is given to testing team by developers to test the application locally. Build numbers are incremental. 
Release: A release is the distribution of the final version of an application to the customer by software development team. 



20. What is bug leakage and bug release? 
Bug Leakage: A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that bug (which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage. 

Bug release: Releasing the software to the Production with some known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note. In other case, releasing the software to the testing team with some known bugs whose severity and priority is low. These bugs can be removed before releasing to production.



21. What is Bug triage? 
Bug triage is a formal process to find which bugs are important by prioritizing them based on their severity, frequency, risk and other important parameters. 
Testers assign priority (high, medium, low) to each and every bug in a bug triage meeting and based on the priority those bugs will be fixed in an order. By doing this we could save a lot of organization’s time. 


28. What is the difference between Compatibility testing and Cross browser testing? 
Compatibility testing: Testing an application on different hardware or software platform is Compatibility testing. Example: Different devices such as iPhone, Samsung etc., Different operating system such as Windows, Linux etc., 

Cross browser testing: Testing a web application on different browsers is Cross browser testing. Cross browser testing is a subset of Compatibility testing. Example: Google Chrome, IE 10, IE 11, Firefox 43 etc.,


5) Are you willing to cut corners to save time? 
The correct answer is NO. All test cases need to be run, and making assumptions frequently leads to issues down the road.


8) How do you go about learning a new product? 
This is perhaps the biggest challenge of being a QA engineer. They need to be comfortable and patient with learning complex software. They should be prepared to ask a lot of questions. 



Q1. In an application currently in production, one module of code is being modified. Is it necessary to retest the whole application or is it enough to just test functionality associated with that module?  
Vijay: Well, the answer is both. You will have to test the functionality of that module as well as the other modules. But you can differentiate on the stress to be given on the module to be tested. 


====================
85. What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63. What is Bucket Testing?
Bucket testing is a method to compare two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

84. What is Bug Release?
Releasing the software to the Production with the known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ques.88. What is mutation testing?
Ans. Mutation testing is a type of white box testing in which the source code of the application is mutated to cause some defect in its working. After that the test scripts are executed to check for their correctness by verifying the failures caused the mutant code.
============================================

Name some OOPS Concepts in Java?
Java is based on Object Oriented Programming Concepts, following are some of the OOPS concepts implemented in java programming.

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism-static/compile //dynamic/overriding
Inheritance
===========================================================================================================================================
What do you mean by platform independence of Java?
Platform independence means that you can run the same Java Program in any Operating System. For example, you can write java program in Windows and run it in Mac OS.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.
===========================================================================================================================================
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
java.lang.Object
===========================================================================================================================================
Why Java is not pure Object Oriented language?
Java is not said to be pure object-oriented because it supports primitive types such as int, byte, short, long etc. I believe it brings simplicity to the language while writing our code. Obviously, java could have wrapper objects for the primitive types but just for the representation, they would not have provided any benefit.
===========================================================================================================================================
**What is difference between path and classpath variables?
PATH is an environment variable used by the operating system to locate the executables.
Classpath is specific to java and used by java executables to locate class files.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is the importance of main method in Java?
main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. The syntax of main method is public static void main(String args[]).

===========================================================================================================================================
What is overloading and overriding in java?
overloading --Static /compile/
overriding --run/dymanci
===========================================================================================================================================
Can we overload main method?
Yes, we can have multiple methods with name “main” in a single class. However if we run the class, java runtime environment will look for main method with syntax as public static void main(String args[]).

===========================================================================================================================================
Can we have multiple public classes in a java source file?
We can’t have more than one public class in a single java source file. A single source file can have multiple classes that are not public.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
java.lang package is imported by default and we don’t need to import any class from this package explicitly.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is final keyword?
final keyword is used with Class to make sure no other class can extend it, for example String class is final and we can’t extend it.

We can use the final keyword with methods to make sure child classes can’t override it.

final keyword can be used with variables to make sure that it can be assigned only once.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is static keyword?
static keyword can be used with class level variables to make it global i.e all the objects will share the same variable.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
===========================================================================================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is multi-catch block in java?
multi-catch block where we can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block. This makes are code shorter and cleaner when every catch block has similar code.
 catch block handles multiple exceptions, you can separate them using a pipe (|) and in this case, exception parameter (ex)

Example :: 
try{
			rethrow("abc");
		}catch(FirstException | SecondException | ThirdException e){
			//below assignment will throw compile time exception since e is final
			//e = new Exception();
			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
		}
===========================================================================================================================================
What is static block?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader.It is used to initialize static variables of the class.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
--abstract keyword is used to create abstract class whereas interface is the keyword for interfaces.
--Abstract classes can have method implementations whereas interfaces can’t.
--A class can extend only one abstract class but it can implement multiple interfaces.
--We can run an abstract class if it has main() method whereas we can’t run an interface.

===========================================================================================================================================
What are Wrapper classes?
Java wrapper classes are the Object representation of eight primitive types in java. All the wrapper classes in java are immutable and final. Java 5 autoboxing and unboxing allows easy conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is Java Annotations?
Annotations is a metadata that are used to provide supplement information about a program.
Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler
===========================================================================================================================================
What does super keyword do?
Super keyword can be used to access super class method when you have overridden the method in the child class.
We can use super keyword to invoke superclass constructor in child class constructor but in this case, it should be the first statement in the constructor method.
Exmaple :
public ChildClass(String str){
		//access super class constructor with super keyword
		super();
		
		//access child class method
		test();
		
		//use super to access super class method
		super.test();
	}
===========================================================================================================================================
What is this keyword?
this keyword provides the reference to the current object and it’s mostly used to make sure that object variables are used, not the local variables having the same name.

===========================================================================================================================================
What is default constructor?
No argument constructor of a class is known as default constructor. When we don’t define any constructor for the class, java compiler automatically creates the default no-args constructor for the class. If there are other constructors defined, then compiler won’t create default constructor for us.

===========================================================================================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

JIT => BC ->Instructions
===========================================================================================================================================
What will be the output of following programs?
public class Test {

	public static String toString(){
		System.out.println("Test toString called");
		return "";
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println(toString());
	}
}

Answer: The code won’t compile because we can’t have an Object class method
===========================================================================================================================================
Is Selenium 2.0 different from Selenium 3.0? If so, how?
Selenium RC is called Selenium 2.0, and the integration of Selenium RC and WebDriver as a single tool has formed Selenium 3.0.
Sel 1 - IDE 
Sel 2 - RC 
Sel 3 - RC +WD 
===========================================================================================================================================
What is XPath?
While DOM is the recognized standard way for navigating through an HTML element tree, XPath is the navigation tool used to locate a web element based on its XML path.
===========================================================================================================================================
What is an object repository?
An object repository allows testers to accumulate web elements of the application under test (AUT), along with their locator values, in one or more centralized locations as restricted to hard-coding them within the test scripts.
===========================================================================================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
===========================================================================================================================================
15. What are data-driven framework and keyword-driven framework?
A data-driven framework in Selenium is an approach of separating a ‘dataset’ from the actual ‘test case’ (code). This framework is completely dependent on the input test data. The test data is inserted from the external sources, such as from an Excel file, a CSV file, or from any database. It also allows us to easily control how much data needs to be tested. We can easily increase the number of test parameters by adding more username and password fields to the Excel file (or other sources).

A keyword-driven framework is an extension to the data-driven testing framework in the sense that it not only isolates the test data from the scripts but also keeps the particular section of the code belonging to the test script in an external data file. These sets of code are known as keywords, and hence the framework is so named. Keywords are self-guiding and work based on what actions need to be performed on the application.
===========================================================================================================================================
How will you use Selenium to upload a file?
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
element = driver.find_element_by_id("fileUpload")
element.send_keys("C:\myfile.txt")
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What is Java?
Answer: Java is an object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language originally designed by James Gosling and further developed by the Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. 
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you mean by Constructor?
Answer: A constructor is a method that has the same name as that of the class to which it belongs. As soon as a new object is created, a constructor corresponding to the class gets invoked. Although the user can explicitly create a constructor, it is created on its own as soon as a class is created. This is known as the default constructor. Constructors can be overloaded.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What are the features of Java?
Platform Independent 
High Speed Language - Uses JIT 
OOPS Concept Based 
Platform Independent 
==========================================================================================================================================
Question: How does Java enable high performance?
In the Just-in-Time compilation, the required code is executed at run time. Typically, it involves translating bytecode into machine code and then executing it directly. For enabling high performance, Java can make use of the Just-In-Time compilation. The JIT compiler is enabled by default in Java and gets activated as soon as a method is called.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you understand by Java IDEs?
Answer: A Java IDE is a software that allows Java developers to easily write as well as debug Java programs.Codenvy, Eclipse, and NetBeans are some of the most popular Java IDEs.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain Local variables and Instance variables in Java.
Even when not assigned, instance variables have a value that can be null, 0, 0.0, or false. This isn’t the case with local variables that need to be assigned a value, where failing to assign a value will yield an error
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What is an Object?
Answer: An instance of a Java class is known as an object. Two important properties of a Java object are behavior and state. An object is created as soon as the JVM comes across the new keyword.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain Method Overriding in Java?
Answer: Method Overriding in Java allows a subclass to offer a specific implementation of a method that has already provided by its parent, or super, class. Method overriding happens if the subclass method and the Superclass method have:

The same name
The same argument
The same return type
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value. 

===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What do you mean by Collections in Java? What are the constituents of Collections in Java?
Answer: A group of objects in Java is known as collections. collections can be considered as a framework designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following operations on objects:

Deletion
Insertion
Manipulation
Searching
Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

Classes – Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector
Interfaces – Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and Sorted Set
Maps – HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
Queues – Priority Queue
Sets – Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How is an Abstract class different from an Interface?
1.)While an interface has neither a constructor nor it can be instantiated, an abstract class can have a default constructor that is called whenever the concrete subclass is instantiated.
2.)Implementation of Methods – All classes that implement the interface need to provide an implementation for all the methods contained by it. A class that extends the abstract class, however, doesn’t require implementing all the methods contained in it. Only abstract methods need to be implemented in the concrete subclass.
3.)Type of Methods – Any abstract class has both abstract as well as non-abstract methods. Interface, on the other hand, has only a single abstract method.

===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Could you explain various types of Exceptions in Java? Also, tell us about the different ways of handling them.
Checked Exceptions – Classes that extend Throwable class, except Runtime exception and Error, are called checked exceptions. Such exceptions are checked by the compiler during the compile time. These types of exceptions must either have appropriate try/catch blocks or be declared using the throws keyword. ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception.

Unchecked Exceptions – Such exceptions aren’t checked by the compiler during the compile time. As such, the compiler doesn’t necessitate handling unchecked exceptions. Arithmetic Exception and ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception are unchecked exceptions.
Exceptions in Java are handled in two ways:

===========================================================================================================================================
Question: What role does the final keyword play in Java? What impact does it have on a variable, method, and class?
When a class is declared as final then it is disabled from being subclassed i.e. no class can extend the final class.
Any method accompanying the final keyword is restricted from being overridden by the subclass.
A variable followed by the final keyword is not able to change the value that it holds during the program execution. So, it behaves like a constant.
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How do you make a thread in Java? Give examples.
Extend the Thread Class – The thread is available in the java.lang.Thread class. In order to make a thread, you need to extend a thread class and override the run method. For example,
public class Addition extends Thread {
public void run() {
}
}

Thread is used for Providing wait , when you want your script to wait for particular time .In that case we use Thread .
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: Is it possible to write multiple catch blocks under a single try block?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to write several catch blocks under a single try block. However, the approach needs to be from specific to general. Following example demonstrates the same:

public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Question: How does the throw keyword differ from the throws keyword?
1.)Throw used inside a function and Throws used in the signature of the function 
2.)Throw can throw one exception at a time , throws can handle multiple exception at a time seperated by comma 

Example 

void Demo() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException 
{ 
// Statements where exceptions might occur. 
throw new ArithmeticException(); 
} 
===========================================================================================================================================
What is "use case testing"?
In order to identify and execute the functional requirement of an application from start to finish "use case" is used and the techniques used to do this is known as "Use Case Testing."
User Action and System Response -
===========================================================================================================================================
7. In white box testing, what do you verify?

In white box testing following steps are verified.

Verify the security holes in the code
Verify the incomplete or broken paths in the code
Verify the flow of structure according to the document specification
Verify the expected outputs
Verify all conditional loops in the code to check the complete functionality of the application
Verify the line by line coding and cover 100% testing
===========================================================================================================================================
What are verification and validation?
Verification is a process of evaluating software at the development phase. It helps you to decide whether the product of a given application satisfies the specified requirements. Validation is the process of evaluating software at the after the development process and to check whether it meets the customer requirements.

14. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.

UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a series of specific tests which determines whether the product will meet the needs of its users.
User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios,
===========================================================================================================================================
15. Mention the difference between Data Driven Testing and Retesting?

Retesting: It is a process of checking bugs that are actioned by the development team to verify that they are fixed.

Data Driven Testing (DDT): In data driven testing process, the application is tested with multiple test data. The application is tested with a different set of values.
===========================================================================================================================================

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.


22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.

22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.

59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

Continue and break -BreaK comes out of loop , while continue helps to come out of current iteration & jumps to loop.

Polymorphism-Static/Compile time/Overloading  //Dynamic/Runtime/overriding 

Singleton class  with example (DB connection) 
Abstraction 
Inheritance 
Encapsulation with example -Binding of code and method ,makes the variable private and methods public -to stop other classes usibg the variables directly .

Data Types (P and NP -String) 

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes
double and float variables  -8byte/4byte and precision (2 decimal and single decimal)


Final Keyword   -class/vari/method

base class in Java -Java.lang.object

Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

Multiple Window in Selenium ::
getWindowHandle() method return a string value and it returns the Window handle of current focused browser window. 

getWindowHandles() method returns a set of all Window handles of all the browsers that were opened in the session.


// Get current window handle
        String parentWinHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
        System.out.println("Parent window handle: " + parentWinHandle);


//Dealing with Multiple Handlers 
Set<String> winHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
        // Loop through all handles
        for(String handle: winHandles){
            if(!handle.equals(parentWinHandle)){
            driver.switchTo().window(handle);
            Thread.sleep(1000);


====================================================================================================
Java Packages -contains classes and Interfaces

Finalise --Used with Garbage collector ,method called before GC to run clean up -means to close the resources asscoiated with objects like DB / netwrok connectn 
It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses. 
finalize() method in Java
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.

Abstarct class and Interface Diff ==========class extends/Implements interface ============does Interface extends/Implements Interface


Why multiple Inheritance not possible in java --Diamond Problem 
Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem



performance implications of Interfaces over abstract classes

Meaning of main method -Public static void main[String(arg())]=====main method of our class as private (No-as it will not allow to compile)


What is Exceptions - event interupting the progm from running, its  type (cmpile/Checked & runtime /unchecked )and handling (try-catch /try-finally)
Finally , how this can be skipped (using system.exit);used with try catch

JIT : byte code to Instructions and helps to make java a fast language 
====

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q13. What is JIT compiler in Java?-It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions
======
Q:Q7. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

===========================================================================================================================================
Q15. Define a Java Class.
A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object. Let’s have a look at the syntax of a class.

===========================================================================================================================================
Example of Break and Continue 

Example break:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if (i == 3)
{
break;
}
System.out.println(i);
}


Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}


===========================================================================================================================================
Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 

===========================================================================================================================================
Q7. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.


===========================================================================================================================================
Q10. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
MultipleInheritance - Java Interview Questions - EdurekaIf a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.

The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.

Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.

20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −

Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.

Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.


example -

 //Include all db values for each text box in an array


            Object[] valueArray = new Object[8] { dbname, dbvendorid, dbcounty, dbstate,
                                                  dbemail, dbphone, dbstatus, dblegacynumber };

            //Enter value, search, and validate for each text box
            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
            {
                Driver.SendKey(elementArray[i], valueArray[i].ToString(), "Search for a value in search panel");
                ClickOnSearch();

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.


===============================================================================================================================================
--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

48. How to check which option in the dropdown is selected?
Answer: Using the isSelected() method we can check the state of a dropdown’s option.

Select countriesDropDown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(“countries”)));
dropdown.selectByVisibleText(“India”);
//returns true or false value
System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.id(“India”)).isSelected());

What is the difference in Collections and Collection in java.
Collection is an interface in java whereas Collections is a utility class has static java methods inside it.
==============================================================================
Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

==============================================================================
Q:Use of OOPs in framework ?polmor /encapsulatin/inheritance/abstraction
Ans -
ABSTRACTION
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. We utilize these locators in tests but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.

Interface 
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); we are initializing Firefox browser using Selenium WebDriver. It means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface (WebDriver) and creating an Object. Here WebDriver is an Interface as mentioned earlier and FirefoxDriver is a class.

INHERITANCE
We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc., in the Base Class.

METHOD OVERLOADING
We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading

ENCAPSULATION
All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.


WEB ELEMENT:
Web element is an interface used to identify the elements in a web page.

WEBDRIVER:
WebDriver is an interface used to launch different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.,

FIND BY:
FindBy is an annotation used in Page Object Model design pattern to identify the elements.

FIND ELEMENT:
Find Element is a method in POM to identify the elements in a web page.

==============================================================================
What are the types of WebDriver APIs available in Selenium?
Firefox Driver
Gecko Driver
InternetExplorer Driver
Chrome Driver
HTMLUnit Driver
Opera Driver
Safari Driver
Android Driver
iPhone Driver
EventFiringWebDriver

==============================================================================
Is the FirefoxDriver a Class or an Interface? 
FirefoxDriver is a Java class, and it implements the WebDriver interface.
==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
==============================================================================
How can we handle windows based pop up?
Selenium doesn’t support windows based applications. It is an automation testing tool which supports only web application testing. We could handle windows based popups in Selenium using some third party tools such as AutoIT, Robot class etc.

        wd.close();
    }
}

--Here get the count of the rows and columns --

===========================================================================================================================================
==Q: How will you handle dynamic elements in selenium ?

Ans - Use regular expression like starts-with , ends-with , contains 

Dynamic elements are web elements which have identifiers that are dynamically generated during run time. Dynamic identifiers could be for any web element of the page but normally used for buttons, text fields and buttons.

Let us take an example of a button whose ID is in the following format…

// Dynamic Element Locators
<button id="Submit-901" />
<button id="Submit-902" />
<button id="Submit-903" />

    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.

68. How to handle hidden elements in Selenium WebDriver? 

It is one of the most important selenium interview questions. 
We can handle hidden elements by using javaScript executor

============================================================================
--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

--Question: Could you draw a comparison between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array necessitates for giving the size during the time of declaration, while an array list doesn't necessarily require size as it changes size dynamically. To put an object into an array, there is the need to specify the index. However, no such requirement is in place for an array list. While an array list is parameterized, an array is not parameterized.

What is JavaScriptExecutor and in which cases JavaScriptExecutor will help in Selenium automation?
In general, we click on an element using click() method in Selenium.

For example:

driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
1
driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
Sometimes web controls don’t react well against selenium commands and we may face issues with the above statement (click()). To overcome such kind of situation, we use JavaScriptExecutor interface.

1. To type Text in Selenium WebDriver without using sendKeys() method
2. To click a Button in Selenium WebDriver using JavaScript
3. To handle Checkbox
4. To generate Alert Pop window in selenium
5. To refresh browser window using Javascript
6. To get innertext of the entire webpage in Selenium
7. To get the Title of our webpage
8. To get the domain
9. To get the URL of a webpage
10. To perform Scroll on an application using  Selenium

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Can you make the constructor of a class static?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java, If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur. In general, static means class level.

=============================================================================
Q:What are the different plugins used for Maven? And it’s used?

prepare

============================================================================
Can we declare the main method of our class as private?

Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?

Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?

Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q50. What's the default access specifier for variables and methods of a class?

Ans: Default access specifier for variables and method is package protected i.e variables and class is available to any other class but in the same package,not outside the package.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q52. How can we restrict inheritance for a class so that no class can be inherited from it?

Ans: If we want a class not to be extended further by any class, we can use the keyword Final with the class name.

In the following example, Stone class is Final and can't be extend

public Final Class Stone {
	// Class methods and Variables
}

}
===============================================================================		
Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Ans: Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. We can apply different methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q57. Which types of exceptions are caught at compile time?

Ans: Checked exceptions can be caught at the time of program compilation. Checked exceptions must be handled by using try catch block in the code in order to successfully compile the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q61. A person says that he compiled a java class successfully without even having a main method in it? Is it possible?

Ans: main method is an entry point of Java class and is required for execution of the program however; a class gets compiled successfully even if it doesn't have a main method. It can't be run though.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q63. What are the two environment variables that must be set in order to run any Java programs?

Ans: Java programs can be executed in a machine only once following two environment variables have been properly set:

PATH variable
CLASSPATH variable

Path --
Once you installed Java on your machine, it is required to Set the PATH environment variable to conveniently run the executable (javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command, such as:

ClassPath -
it is speciifc to java 
===========================================================================================================================================
Q64. Can variables be used in Java without initialization?
Ans: In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn't compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q65. Can a class in Java be inherited from more than one class?
Ans: In Java, a class can be derived from only one class and not from multiple classes. Multiple inheritances is not supported by Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q66. Can a constructor have different name than a Class name in Java?

Ans: Constructor in Java must have same name as the class name and if the name is different, it doesn't act as a constructor and compiler thinks of it as a normal method.

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?
A regular expression is a special text string used for describing a search pattern. In Selenium IDE regular expression can be used with the keyword- regexp: as a prefix to the value and patterns needs to be included for the expected values.

5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?
No. System testing should start only if all modules are in place and they work correctly. However, it should be performed before UAT (user acceptance testing).

===========================================================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?

Why Variable in the Interface is public static final ?

public: for the accessibility across all the classes, just like the methods present in the interface

static: as interface cannot have an object, the interfaceName.variableName can be used to reference it or directly the variableName in the class implementing it.

final: to make them constants. If 2 classes implement the same interface and you give both of them the right to change the value, conflict will occur in the current value of the var, which is why only one time initialization is permitted.

What is an anonymous inner class? How is it different from an inner class?
Any local inner class which has no name is known as an anonymous inner class. Since it doesn’t have any name, it is impossible to create its constructor. It always either extends a class or implements an interface, and is defined and instantiated in a single statement.

A non-static nested class is called an inner class. Inner classes are associated with the objects of the class and they can access all methods and variables of the outer class.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Test(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)

What is the difference between @Factory and @Data Provider annotation?
Answer: @DataProvider is concerned with individual test methods and run the specific methods for many times. @Factory method creates test class instances and runs all the test methods in that class with different data. sets.

Factory and @DataProvider annotation
TestNG Factory is useful when you want to run multiple test classes through a single test class.
Example 

public class Test1 {

	@Test
	public void test1() {
		System.out.println("Test1 test method");
	}
}


public class Test2 {

	@Test
	public void test2() {
		System.out.println("Test2 test method");
	}
}


Public class TestNGFactory {

	@Factory()
	public Object[] getTestClasses() {
		Object[] tests = new Object[2];
		tests[0] = new Test1();
		tests[1] = new Test2();

==============================================================================
Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?

The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one .
Singletons often control access to resources, such as database connections or sockets.

Example :  you have a license for only one connection for your database or your JDBC driver has trouble with multithreading, the Singleton makes sure that only one connection is made or that only one thread can access the connection at a time.

Creating Singleton class ==>
To design a singleton class:
1.Make constructor as private.
2.Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.

Normal class vs Singleton class: Difference in normal and singleton class in terms of instantiation is that, For normal class we use constructor, whereas for singleton class we use getInstance() method 

==============================================================================
Explain System.out.println();
--System : is a final class in  java.lang package.As this is final class so this cannot be inherited 
--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Super 
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Public class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  

Public class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
Public void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  i.e black 
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  i.e white
}  
}

Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.
=============================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}

==============================================================================
Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.
==============================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.

What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes in abstarct class and No in Interface 
==============================================================================
Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there.

QQ. How to locate a link using its text in selenium?
WebElement link1 = driver.findElement(By.linkText(“artOfTesting”));
WebElement link2 = driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText(“artOf”));
==============================================================================
Q:why not WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();?
Answer is – As per the Selenium WebDriver docs,  WebDriver is an interface and we can not create instance of an interface.

===================================================================================================================================
42 : Can We Overload main method in java?
Answer : Yes, Java class can have any number of main methods so it is possible to overload main method. But when you run program, It will not execute overloaded main method. Always It will execute only public static void main(String[] args) method.Run time error milega
==============================================================================
What is the importance of main method in Java?
main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. The syntax of main method is public static void main(String args[]).
============================================================================
Can we have multiple public classes in a java source file?
We can’t have more than one public class in a single java source file. A single source file can have multiple classes that are not public.
==============================================================================
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
java.lang package is imported by default and we don’t need to import any class from this package explicitly.
==============================================================================
What is static keyword?
static keyword can be used with class level variables to make it global i.e all the objects will share the same variable.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
=============================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
============================================================================
Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order

Q: What is  differences between API and Web Service?

All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.

===================================================================================================================================
Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.
============================================================================
Q:: Can we test APIs or web services using Selenium webdriver?
No selenium webdriver uses browser's native method to automate the web applications. Since web services are headless, so we cannot automate web services using selenium webdriver.

==============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
==============================================================================
Q:Difference between @BeforeTest and @BeforeMethod in TestNG? -----
@BeforeTest Will be called before any Test only..
@BeforeMethod will be called before every method
Note that, not every method in a file is Test, but every Test in a file is a method.

==============================================================================
What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

===============================================================================
Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?
A regular expression is a special text string used for describing a search pattern. In Selenium IDE regular expression can be used with the keyword- regexp: as a prefix to the value and patterns needs to be included for the expected values.

16 : Can we overload static methods? 
Ans:yes , both static as well as non static 

public class Test { 
    public static void foo() { 
        System.out.println("Test.foo() called "); 
    } 
    public static void foo(int a) {  
        System.out.println("Test.foo(int) called "); 
    } 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {  
        Test.foo(); 
        Test.foo(10); 
    } 
} 

===============================================================================
18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}


----Another example 

Interface 
Public  interface X
{
   public void myMethod();//abstract method 
}

Public interface Y
{
   public void myMethod();
}

Public  class JavaExample implements X, Y
{
   public void myMethod()
   {
       System.out.println("Implementing more than one interfaces");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
	   JavaExample obj = new JavaExample();

42. What is fluent wait in selenium?
A fluent wait is a type of wait in which we can also specify polling interval(intervals after which driver will try to find the element) along with the maximum timeout value.

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Example of explicit wait 
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Syntax :
Implicit wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);	
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;	

explicit wait :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Question: What do you mean by Collections in Java? What are the constituents of Collections in Java?
Answer: A group of objects in Java is known as collections. collections can be considered as a framework designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following operations on objects:

Deletion
Insertion
Manipulation
Searching
Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

Classes – Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector
Interfaces – Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and Sorted Set
Maps – HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
Queues – Priority Queue
Sets – Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set

Q:Can Constructor can be private 

Ans Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.
===============================================================================
Question: Can a class be private?
Answer: Only nested or inner classes can be private because they can be accessed by the outer class. A normal class cannot be final because you can not instantiate it (create object).
===============================================================================
Question: How is a constant variable different from a global variable?
Answer: Global variables can be modified and are accessible by all the functions in a program. Constant variables have a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the program.

Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}

What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

===============================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object 
===============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.
===============================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:can we use the same code in catch block ?
Only error prone code is within the try block and the handling of that error is written in the catch block..Catch block is use to handle run time exception ?
===============================================================================
18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}

2. Explain the review process you follow in your organization? 
A. The various phases of the review process followed in my organization are: 
Planning: >selecting the personal for review >allocating roles >defining entry and exit criteria. 
Kick-off: >Distributing documents >explaining the objectives >checking entry criteria, etc.
Individual preparation: > in the phase, each of the participants will work before the review meeting and be ready with questions and comments. 
Review Meeting: > Discussion among the review members by going through each line of the work product. > Logging comments > Making decision about the defect.
Rework: > Fixing defects found during the review, typically done by the author. 
Follow-up: > checking the defects that have been addressed. >gathering metrics and checking the exit criteria.
----------------------------------------------------
23. What are the roles present in the review? 

==Manager: >decides on execution of reviews. > allocates time in project schedules. > determines if the review objectives have met.
==Moderator: >leads the review, including planning and running the meeting >follows-up after the meeting. 
==Author: The author is the person who has created the item to be reviewed. the author may also be asked questions within the review. 
==Reviewer: The reviewer are the attendees of the review who attempt to find errors in the item under review. they should come from different perspectives in order to provide a well balanced review of the item.
==scribe: The scribe or recorder is the person who is responsible for documenting issues raised during the process of the review meeting
----------------------------------------------------
29. Explain what do you document during the review process? 
A. we document page and line number of defect, origin of defect, severity of defect. We also document other information like work product ID, reviewers, etc

Question: What do you mean by Collections in Java? What are the constituents of Collections in Java?
Answer: A group of objects in Java is known as collections. collections can be considered as a framework designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following operations on objects:

Deletion
Insertion
Manipulation
Searching
Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

Classes – Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector
Interfaces – Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and Sorted Set
Maps – HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
Queues – Priority Queue
Sets – Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set

*Q: Example of static class 

class OuterClass {
    private static String msg = "GeeksForGeeks";
  
    // Static nested class
    public static class NestedStaticClass {
  
        // Only static members of Outer class
        // is directly accessible in nested
        // static class
        public void printMessage()
        {
  
            // Try making 'message' a non-static
            // variable, there will be compiler error
            System.out.println(
                "Message from nested static class: "
                + msg);
        }
    }
  
  
Advantage of static class - Nested class to be mase as static class , it can use any variable of outer class even without intializing .example dekho upar wala 

===============================================================================
Q:Can Constructor can be private 

Ans Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.
===============================================================================
Question: How is a constant variable different from a global variable?
Answer: Global variables can be modified and are accessible by all the functions in a program. Constant variables have a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the program.

===============================================================================
public class TestNG {
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 
 @Test (priority = 0)
 public void CloseBrowser() {
 driver.close();
 System.out.println("Closing Google Chrome browser");
 }
 
 @Test (priority = -1)
 public void OpenBrowser() {
 System.out.println("Launching Google Chrome browser");         
 driver.get("https://www.demoqa.com");
 }
 
 @Test
 public void AccountTest(){
 System.out.println("Some tests for Customer Account");
 }
}


Answer - first -1 priority wale method will run ---> then Account test wala and at last 0 prioty wala
Observe that the AccountTest method ran before CloseBrowser even without having any priority because both sets to priority = 0, and hence, they run alphabetically.

Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}  
}

Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.


package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase1()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase1");  
 }  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase2()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase2");  
 }  
 @Test(dependsOnGroups="test")  
 public void testcase3()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase3");  
 }  
}  

===============================================================================
What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 

===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

===============================================================================
Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 

===============================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.

===============================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 

===============================================================================
Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 

===============================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

===============================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.

===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===============================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================
1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

        System.out.println("This will run before the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @After
    public void afterScenario(){
        System.out.println("This will run after the every Scenario");
    }
 
 @Before("@First")
    public void beforeFirst(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the First Scenario");
    } 
 
 @Before("@Second")
    public void beforeSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only before the Second Scenario");
    } 
 
 
 @After("@First")

    } 
 
 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");   
    } 

}
Note: We learned that @Before & @After hooks run before & after every Scenario. But @Before(“@First”) will run only before the first scenario and likewise other tagged hooks. Again, these tags names can be anything and no need to be first, second and third.

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.
501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 
500 (Internal Server Error)
415 (Unsupported Media Type)
412 (Precondition Failed)
404 (Not Found)
401 (Unauthorized)
201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource
204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content
202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

Q #10) What is a dependency on TestNG?

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)

driver.findElement(By.id(“login”)).sendkeys(user_name);
driver.findElement(By.id(“password”)).sendkeys(password);
}


Now, go to the testng.xml file and enter the parameters there as follows:

<Suite name = “suitename”>
<test name =”testname”>
<parameter name =”user_name” value=”user1”/>
<parameter password =”password” value =”pass1”/>

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )

===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

Ans -Constructor cannot be static because it cannot be call as method or variable, so no need to placing a static variable before constructor. abstract means incomplete, for complementing it we need an implementation class/interface. Constructor doesn't required to be abstract because it doesn't need to be implemented.
===============================================================================
Q:33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

This way variables cannot be called in another class .
===============================================================================
35. Why do we mark main method as static in Java?

===============================================================================
43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return
type of method in java?

Overloading is the mechanism of binding the method call with the method body dynamically based on the parameters passed to the method call. ... It is not possible to decide to execute which method based on the return type, therefore, overloading is not possible just by changing the return type of the method.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

===============================================================================
62. Is it allowed to mark an interface method as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.
===============================================================================
79. What is java.lang package?
Java.lang package contains the classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. 

===============================================================================
Q:Can you make the constructor of a class static?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java, If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur. In general, static means class level.
===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
62. Is it allowed to mark an  method in interface  as static?

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to is.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main() method?

Program compiles. But at runtime throws an error "NoSuchMethodError".
===============================================================================
What if I do not provide the String array as the argument to the method?
Program compiles but throws a runtime error "NoSuchMethodError".

No. It is by default loaded internally by the JVM.

===============================================================================
Are the imports checked for validity at compile time? Example: will the code containing an import such as java.lang.ABCD compile?

Yes the imports are checked for the semantic validity at compile time. The code containing above line of import will not compile
===============================================================================
What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.
===============================================================================
What type of parameter passing does Java support?

In Java the arguments are always passed by value.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q: grouping in testNG 

Ans 
Suppose there are 3 methods 

@Test(groups="regression")
public void M1(){
system.out.printLn("M1");
}

@Test(groups="smoke")
public void M2(){
system.out.printLn("M2");
}


@Test(groups="smoke" , "regression")
public void M3(){
system.out.printLn("M3");
}

Now you want to run particular group test cases

8 Where to use hashmap & where hash table?

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.
HashMap- not synchronished , HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values ,HashMap is fast. HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.
HashTables - sychronised , slow , Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value. , Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

Q:Differnce in findBy , findBys and FindAll

@FindBys : When the required WebElement objects need to match all of the given criteria use @FindBys annotation

@FindAll : When required WebElement objects need to match at least one of the given criteria use @FindAll annotation

Usage:

@FindBys( {
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
} )
private List<WebElement> elementsWithBoth_class1ANDclass2;
Here List elementsWithBothclass1ANDclass2 will contain any WebElement which satisfies both criteria.

@FindAll({
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
})
private List<WebElement> elementsWithEither_class1ORclass2

What is the difference between error and exception in java?

Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory.

===============================================================================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

2. How do we achieve parallel execution in TestNG?
Parallel testing or parallel execution, as the name suggests, is a process of running the test case parallelly rather than one after the other. In parallel testing, the program’s multiple parts (or modules) execute together, saving the testers a lot of time and effort. The operating system’s functionalities do this, but as a user, we need to trigger parallel execution through TestNG. As an example, you can think of having software with two different versions and running them in parallel with the help of TestNG. Parallel execution would give us the correct idea of the stability and performance of the software much faster than running serially.

4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================
What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? 
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.
===============================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?

===============================================================================
Q: WHat is thread in testNG.XML file in case of parallel testing ?

Threads in parallel testing refer to different parts in which the test execution will be divided and run parallelly

So if there are two threads and two methods, they will take one method each and run them parallelly (if we are running the methods parallelly). But if there are three methods and two threads, one will have to wait until one thread is free and takes up that method for execution. Therefore, we need to specify the number of threads we want to run while performing parallel testing in TestNG.

   <test name = "Parallel Tests" parallel = "methods" thread-count = "2">--------------------------------Es ki baat ho rhi hai 
      <classes>
         <class name = "ParallelTest" />
      </classes>

Note - example let us suppose there are 3 methods and you defined thread as 2 .then 2 parallel chalenge , aur jab ek thread free hogi tab woh 3rd method ke liye chalega .In this case 2 methods ka same thread id hoga aur 3rd ka alag ...
===============================================================================
As I mentioned, if we run the test methods directly through the test case file (Run As -> TestNG Test) rather than the XML file, they will run serially. Run the file in the same way (serially) and notice the time taken for overall execution.

17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){

   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.

TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.
All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver class.
All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

8) If try With Multiple catch Block Present, Is Order of catch Blocks Important in 
Which Order We Have To Take?

Yes , jaise aapke codd mein pehle arthmetic error aani hai to pehle uske respective catch block hona chaiye ..
agli exception say IO error h , then uske respective block hona chaiye 
===============================================================================
10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--
===============================================================================
11)Is it Possible To Take try, catch Inside try Block?
No , In Java, we can use a try block within a try block. Each time a try statement is entered, the context of that exception is pushed on to a stack

===============================================================================
16)In Which Situation Finally Block Will Not Executed?
Ans - if try block will have a statement System.exit();
===============================================================================
17)If Return Statement Present Inside try, is Finally Block Will Be Executed?
Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed.
===============================================================================
19)Is it Possible To Write Any Statement Between try-catch And finally?
No, we cannot write any statements in between try, catch and finally blocks and these blocks form one unit
===============================================================================
20)Is it Possible To Take 2 finally Blocks For The Same try?
You can only have one finally clause per try/catch/finally statement
===============================================================================
29)Is it Possible To Use throws Keyword For Any Java Class?
No ,It is used in method definition, to declare that a risky method is being called.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.

20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −

Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.

Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.

==============================================================================
--HashMap and HashSet 

==============================================================================
--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

What is a Framework?

A framework defines a set of rules or best practices which we can follow in a systematic way to achieve the desired results.
==============================================================================
Q:Use of OOPs in framework ?polmor /encapsulatin/inheritance/abstraction
Ans -
ABSTRACTION
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. We utilize these locators in tests but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.

Interface 
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); we are initializing Firefox browser using Selenium WebDriver. It means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface (WebDriver) and creating an Object. Here WebDriver is an Interface as mentioned earlier and FirefoxDriver is a class.

INHERITANCE
We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc., in the Base Class.

METHOD OVERLOADING
We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading

ENCAPSULATION
All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.


WEB ELEMENT:
Web element is an interface used to identify the elements in a web page.

WEBDRIVER:
WebDriver is an interface used to launch different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.,

FIND BY:
FindBy is an annotation used in Page Object Model design pattern to identify the elements.

FIND ELEMENT:
Find Element is a method in POM to identify the elements in a web page.

22. What is a hub in Selenium Grid?
A hub is a server or a central point that controls the test executions on different machines.

23. What is a node in Selenium Grid?
Node is the machine which is attached to the hub. There can be multiple nodes in Selenium Grid.

==============================================================================
What are the types of WebDriver APIs available in Selenium?
Firefox Driver
Gecko Driver
InternetExplorer Driver
Chrome Driver
HTMLUnit Driver
Opera Driver
Safari Driver
Android Driver
iPhone Driver
EventFiringWebDriver

==============================================================================
What are the Programming Languages supported by Selenium WebDiver?
Java
C#
Python
Ruby
Perl
PHP
==============================================================================
Is the FirefoxDriver a Class or an Interface? 
FirefoxDriver is a Java class, and it implements the WebDriver interface.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
==============================================================================
How can we handle windows based pop up?
Selenium doesn’t support windows based applications. It is an automation testing tool which supports only web application testing. We could handle windows based popups in Selenium using some third party tools such as AutoIT, Robot class etc.


==============================================================================
Q: How to use Auto It ?
==============================================================================
--Implicit , explicit , fluent : write down 
driver.manage().TimeOut.ImplicitWait(TimeOut.seconds,30);

        wd.close();
    }
}

--Here get the count of the rows and columns --

===========================================================================================================================================
==Q: How will you handle dynamic elements in selenium ?

Ans - Use regular expression like starts-with , ends-with , contains 

Dynamic elements are web elements which have identifiers that are dynamically generated during run time. Dynamic identifiers could be for any web element of the page but normally used for buttons, text fields and buttons.

Let us take an example of a button whose ID is in the following format…

// Dynamic Element Locators
<button id="Submit-901" />
<button id="Submit-902" />
<button id="Submit-903" />

68. How to handle hidden elements in Selenium WebDriver?

===========================================================================================================================================
--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name

--Question: Could you draw a comparison between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array necessitates for giving the size during the time of declaration, while an array list doesn't necessarily require size as it changes size dynamically. To put an object into an array, there is the need to specify the index. However, no such requirement is in place for an array list. While an array list is parameterized, an array is not parameterized.

20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −

Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.

Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.

Q:Selenium webdriver archietecture ?

Selenium Client Library
JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client
Browser Drivers
Browsers

1. Selenium Client Libraries/Language Bindings

Selenium supports multiple libraries such as Java, Ruby, Python, etc. Selenium Developers have developed language bindings to allow Selenium to support multiple languages. If you wish to know more about libraries, kindly refer to the official site for Selenium libraries.

2. JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to transfer data between a server and a client on the web. JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP server. Each BrowserDriver (such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, etc.) has its own HTTP server.

3. Browser Drivers

Each browser contains a separate browser driver. Browser drivers communicate with the respective browser without revealing the internal logic of the browser’s functionality. When a browser driver has received any command then that command will be executed on the respective browser and the response will go back in the form of an HTTP response.

4. Browsers

Selenium supports multiple browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, etc.


Explanation
WebDriver driver  = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");

Once you are ready with your script, you will click on Run to execute the program. Based on the above statements, the Firefox browser will be launched and it will navigate to Edureka website.

Once you click on ‘Run’, every statement in your script will be converted as a URL, with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP. The URL’s will be passed to the Browser Drivers. (In the above code, I have used FirefoxDriver). Here, in this case, the client library (Java) will convert the statements of the script into JSON format and further communicate with the FirefoxDriver. 

Every Browser Driver uses an HTTP server to receive HTTP requests. Once the URL reaches the Browser Driver, then it will pass that request to the real browser over HTTP. Once done, the commands in your Selenium script will be executed on the browser. In the case of Chrome browser, you can write your Selenium script as shown below:

WebDriver driver  = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");
If the request is POST request, then there will be an action on the browser. If the request is a GET request then the corresponding response will be generated at the browser end. It will be then sent over HTTP to the browser driver and the Browser Driver over JSON Wire Protocol and sends it to the UI (Eclipse IDE).

Q: What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is JavaScriptExecutor and in which cases JavaScriptExecutor will help in Selenium automation?
In general, we click on an element using click() method in Selenium.

For example:

driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
1
driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
Sometimes web controls don’t react well against selenium commands and we may face issues with the above statement (click()). To overcome such kind of situation, we use JavaScriptExecutor interface.

1. To type Text in Selenium WebDriver without using sendKeys() method
2. To click a Button in Selenium WebDriver using JavaScript
3. To handle Checkbox
4. To generate Alert Pop window in selenium
5. To refresh browser window using Javascript
6. To get innertext of the entire webpage in Selenium
7. To get the Title of our webpage
8. To get the domain
9. To get the URL of a webpage
10. To perform Scroll on an application using  Selenium
11. To click on a SubMenu which is only visible on mouse hover on Menu
12. To navigate to different page using Javascript

Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader.It is used to initialize static variables of the class.

==============================================================================================
Question: Is it possible to write multiple catch blocks under a single try block?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to write several catch blocks under a single try block. However, the approach needs to be from specific to general. Following example demonstrates the same:

public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}

What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
==============================================================================================
What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader.

==============================================================================================
What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.
==============================================================================================

Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Difference in hooks and background 

Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in a single feature. A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps. The difference is when it is run. 

================>The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your Before Hooks<===================

Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy.They are typically used for setup and tear down of the environment before and after each scenario.


Use Background only to setup a pre-condition that the user needs to know.

Note : Pehle Hooks chalte hain fir background keyword

Using Random class in package java.util

===========================================================================================================================================
Q13. What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.

main method ---->
public class switchExample {
    int score = 4;
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        switch (score) {
            case 1:
                system.out.println("Score is 1");
                break;
            case 2:
                system.out.println("Score is 2");
                break;
            default:
                system.out.println("Default Case");
        }
    }
}

===========================================================================================================================================
Can we declare the main method of our class as private?

Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?

Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?

Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q35. What is multi-threading?

Ans: Multi threading is a programming concept to run multiple tasks in a concurrent manner within a single program. Threads share same process stack and running in parallel. It helps in performance improvement of any program.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?

Ans: If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q42. Can a class be a super class and a sub-class at the same time? Give example.

Ans: If there is a hierarchy of inheritance used, a class can be a super class for another class and a sub-class for another one at the same time.

public class world {

..........

}
public class continenet extends world {

............

}
public class country extends continent {

......................

}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q46. There are two classes named classA and classB. Both classes are in the same package. Can a private member of classA can be accessed by an object of classB?

Ans: Private members of a class aren't accessible outside the scope of that class and any other class even in the same package can't access them.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q50. What's the default access specifier for variables and methods of a class?

Ans: Default access specifier for variables and method is package protected i.e variables and class is available to any other class but in the same package,not outside the package.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q52. How can we restrict inheritance for a class so that no class can be inherited from it?

Ans: If we want a class not to be extended further by any class, we can use the keyword Final with the class name.

In the following example, Stone class is Final and can't be extend

public Final Class Stone {
	// Class methods and Variables
}

===========================================================================================================================================
Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Ans: Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. We can apply different methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q57. Which types of exceptions are caught at compile time?

Ans: Checked exceptions can be caught at the time of program compilation. Checked exceptions must be handled by using try catch block in the code in order to successfully compile the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q61. A person says that he compiled a java class successfully without even having a main method in it? Is it possible?

Ans: main method is an entry point of Java class and is required for execution of the program however; a class gets compiled successfully even if it doesn't have a main method. It can't be run though.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q63. What are the two environment variables that must be set in order to run any Java programs?

Ans: Java programs can be executed in a machine only once following two environment variables have been properly set:

PATH variable
CLASSPATH variable

Path --
Once you installed Java on your machine, it is required to Set the PATH environment variable to conveniently run the executable (javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command, such as:

ClassPath -
it is speciifc to java 
===========================================================================================================================================
Q64. Can variables be used in Java without initialization?
Ans: In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn't compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q65. Can a class in Java be inherited from more than one class?
Ans: In Java, a class can be derived from only one class and not from multiple classes. Multiple inheritances is not supported by Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q66. Can a constructor have different name than a Class name in Java?

Ans: Constructor in Java must have same name as the class name and if the name is different, it doesn't act as a constructor and compiler thinks of it as a normal method.

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

Q: Selenium Grid ?
The Selenium Grid is a testing tool which allows us to run our tests on different machines against different browsers. It is a part of the Selenium Suite which specialise in running multiple tests across different browsers, operating system and machines.

Hub : In Selenium Grid, the hub is a computer which is the central point where we can load our tests into. Hub also acts as a server because of which it acts as a central point to control the network of Test machines. 

Node : In Selenium Grid, a node is referred to a Test Machine which opts to connect with the Hub. This test machine will be used by Hub to run tests on. A Grid network can have multiple nodes. A node is supposed to have different platforms i.e. different operating system and browsers. The node does not need the same platform for running as that of hub.

Q:Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

===========================================================================================================================================
14. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.

UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a series of specific tests which determines whether the product will meet the needs of its users.
User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios,
===========================================================================================================================================
15. Mention the difference between Data Driven Testing and Retesting?

Retesting: It is a process of checking bugs that are actioned by the development team to verify that they are fixed.

Data Driven Testing (DDT): In data driven testing process, the application is tested with multiple test data. The application is tested with a different set of values.
===========================================================================================================================================
32. Explain what is testing type and what are the commonly used testing type?

Unit Testing: Test the smallest code of an application
API Testing: Testing API created for the application
Integration Testing: Individual software modules are combined and tested
System Testing: Complete testing of the system
Install/UnInstall Testing: Testing done from the point of client/customer view
Agile Testing: Testing through Agile technique
===========================================================================================================================================
2) What is Testware?
Testware is test artifacts like test cases, test data, test plans needed to design and execute a test.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q::What is the difference between build and release?
Build: It is a number given to Installable software that is given to the testing team by the development team.

Release: It is a number given to Installable software that is handed over to the customer by the tester or developer.

===========================================================================================================================================
Explain the steps for Bug Cycle?

===========================================================================================================================================

Alpha and Beta testing
Load testing and stress testing
System testing
===========================================================================================================================================
17) Explain stress testing, load testing and volume testing?
Load Testing: Testing an application under heavy but expected load is known as Load Testing. Here, the load refers to the large volume of users, messages, requests, data, etc.
Stress Testing: When the load placed on the system is raised or accelerated beyond the normal range then it is known as Stress Testing.
Volume Testing: The process of checking the system, whether the system can handle the required amounts of data, user requests, etc. is known as Volume Testing.
===========================================================================================================================================
23) What is Ad Hoc testing?
It is a testing phase where the tester tries to break the system by randomly trying the system's functionality. It can include negative testing as wel
===========================================================================================================================================
25) Explain what are test driver and test stub and why it is required?
The stub is called from the software component to be tested. It is used in top down approach
The driver calls a component to be tested. It is used in bottom up approach
It is required when we need to test the interface between modules X and Y and we have developed only module X. So we cannot just test module X but if there is any dummy module we can use that dummy module to test module X
===========================================================================================================================================
1) What is the difference between the QA and software testing?

The role of QA (Quality Assurance) is to monitor the quality of the "process" used to produce the software. While the software testing, is the process of ensuring the functionality of final product meets the user's requirement.
==========================================================================
Ques.44. What is a test harness? Why do we need a test harness?
Ans. A test harness is a collection of test scripts and test data usually associated with unit and integration testing. It involves stubs and drivers that are required for testing software modules and integrated components.

=======================================================================
Q95). How to retire the data from Encapsulation?
Using getter and setter method we can access the data.
=======================================================================
5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?
No. System testing should start only if all modules are in place and they work correctly. However, it should be performed before UAT (user acceptance testing).
===============================================================================================================

name[1] = “book”
------->>>>
however we can directly put objectnin arraylist
No index required.

name.add(“book”)
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix
===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

===========================================================================================================================================
Q15. Define a Java Class.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 

===========================================================================================================================================
Q10. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
MultipleInheritance - Java Interview Questions - EdurekaIf a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.

The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.

Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.


===================================================================================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?

What is same origin policy? How you can avoid same origin policy?

The “Same Origin Policy” is introduced for security reason, and it ensures that content of your site will never be accessible by a script from another site.  As per the policy, any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website’s domain.

To avoid “Same Origin Policy” proxy injection method is used, in proxy injection mode the Selenium Server acts as a client configured HTTP proxy , which sits between the browser and application under test and then masks the AUT under a fictional URL

2.git commit 
3.git push 
4.git pull
5.git clone 
6.git add  ---> to make the files ready to commit (add all fiels to stage )/ ready to make them commit ---> run git add filename. //saari files add karne ke run git add .
7.git show 
8.git merge 
9.git branch 
10.git status --> this will tll koi untracked file to nahe hai ( these files needs to be add using git add ) :: To check the status ->go to that folder jaha code hai

What is API testing?

API (Application Programming Interface) specifies how some software components should interact with other, in other words it’s a set of functions and procedures that allows the creation of applications which access the features or data of an application or operating system.   Testing of these functions is known as API testing.

API is the middle layer between the presentation (UI) and the database layer. APIs enable communication and data exchange from one software system to another.

There are three separate layers in a typical app: the presentation (or user interface) layer, the business layer, and the database layer for modeling and manipulating data.
API testing is performed at the most critical layer: business, in which business logic processing is carried out and all transactions between the user interface and database layers happen.

What is desired capabilities?
Desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
desired capabalities are for chrome and for furefox we use firfoxoption
desired capabilities are used for chrome , for firefox we use firefox options 

============================================
Why Variable in the Interface is public static final ?

public: for the accessibility across all the classes, just like the methods present in the interface

static: as interface cannot have an object, the interfaceName.variableName can be used to reference it or directly the variableName in the class implementing it.

final: to make them constants. If 2 classes implement the same interface and you give both of them the right to change the value, conflict will occur in the current value of the var, which is why only one time initialization is permitted.

Q:Name the superclass in Java.
Java.lang. All different non-primitive are inherited directly or indirectly from this class.
=========================================================================================================================================================
What is an anonymous inner class? How is it different from an inner class?
Any local inner class which has no name is known as an anonymous inner class. Since it doesn’t have any name, it is impossible to create its constructor. It always either extends a class or implements an interface, and is defined and instantiated in a single statement.

A non-static nested class is called an inner class. Inner classes are associated with the objects of the class and they can access all methods and variables of the outer class.
=========================================================================================================================================================
What is a system class?
It is a core class in Java. Since the class is final, we cannot override its behavior through inheritance. Neither can we instantiate this class since it doesn’t provide any public constructors. Hence, all of its methods are static.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )
public class FailedScenarios {

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q:Difference in hooks and background 

Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in a single feature. A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps. The difference is when it is run. The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your Before Hooks.

Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy.They are typically used for setup and tear down of the environment before and after each scenario.


Use Background only to setup a pre-condition that the user needs to know

Q:Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value. 

===================================================================================================================================

===========================================================================================================================================
23) What is Ad Hoc testing?
It is a testing phase where the tester tries to break the system by randomly trying the system's functionality. It can include negative testing as wel
===========================================================================================================================================
25) Explain what are test driver and test stub and why it is required?
The stub is called from the software component to be tested. It is used in top down approach
The driver calls a component to be tested. It is used in bottom up approach
It is required when we need to test the interface between modules X and Y and we have developed only module X. So we cannot just test module X but if there is any dummy module we can use that dummy module to test module X

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #28) Should any code be written within the TestRunner class?
Ans: No code should be written under the TestRunner class. It should include the tags @RunWith and @CucumberOptions.
========================================================================================================================================================================================
1) What is the difference between the QA and software testing?

The role of QA (Quality Assurance) is to monitor the quality of the "process" used to produce the software. While the software testing, is the process of ensuring the functionality of final product meets the user's requirement.
==========================================================================
Ques.44. What is a test harness? Why do we need a test harness?
Ans. A test harness is a collection of test scripts and test data usually associated with unit and integration testing. It involves stubs and drivers that are required for testing software modules and integrated components.

=======================================================================
Q95). How to retire the data from Encapsulation?
Using getter and setter method we can access the data.
=======================================================================
5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?
No. System testing should start only if all modules are in place and they work correctly. However, it should be performed before UAT (user acceptance testing).
===============================================================================================================
16. The probability that a server-class application hosted on the cloud is up and running for six long months without crashing is 99.99 percentage. To analyze this type of a scenario, what test you will perform?

Reliability testing
===============================================================================================================
19. How do you test a product if the requirements are yet to be freezed?
If the required specifications are not available for a product, then a test plan can be created based on the assumptions made about the product. But we should get all assumptions well-documented in the test plan.
===============================================================================================================
22. Is there any difference between retesting and regression testing?
===============================================================================================================
24. What are the different types of functional testing?
Functional testing covers the following types of validation techniques:

Unit testing
Smoke testing
UAT
Sanity testing
Interface testing
Integration testing
System testing
Regression testing

41. What is the difference between performance testing and monkey testing?
Performance testing checks the speed, scalability, and/or stability characteristics of a system. Performance is identified with achieving response time, throughput, and resource-utilization levels that meet the performance objectives for a project or a product.

Monkey testing is a technique in software testing where the user tests the application by providing random inputs, checking the behavior of the application (or trying to crash the application).
===============================================================================================================
Q #3) How does Java enable high performance?
Ans: Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. JIT is used to convert the bytecodes into machine readable code.
===============================================================================================================
Q #4) What are the Java IDE’s?
Ans: Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE's of JAVA.
===============================================================================================================
Q #15) What is meant by Interface?
All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
The class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
===============================================================================================================
Q #17) Difference between Array and Array List.

Array :
Size should be given at the time of array declaration.
To put an object into array we need to specify the index.

name[1] = “book”
------->>>>
however we can directly put objectnin arraylist
No index required.

name.add(“book”)
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix
===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

base class in Java -Java.lang.object
==========================================================================================================================================================
Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

Multiple Window in Selenium ::
getWindowHandle() method return a string value and it returns the Window handle of current focused browser window. 

getWindowHandles() method returns a set of all Window handles of all the browsers that were opened in the session.


// Get current window handle
        String parentWinHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
        System.out.println("Parent window handle: " + parentWinHandle);


//Dealing with Multiple Handlers 
Set<String> winHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
        // Loop through all handles
        for(String handle: winHandles){
            if(!handle.equals(parentWinHandle)){
            driver.switchTo().window(handle);
            Thread.sleep(1000);


====================================================================================================
Java Packages -contains classes and Interfaces

Finalise --Used with Garbage collector ,method called before GC to run clean up -means to close the resources asscoiated with objects like DB / netwrok connectn 
It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses. 
finalize() method in Java
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?

Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened
Report: Report the issues to higher level manager
Control: Define the issue management process

Answer: The code won’t compile because we havent called the static method
===========================================================================================================================================
What are verification and validation?
Verification is a process of evaluating software at the development phase. It helps you to decide whether the product of a given application satisfies the specified requirements. Validation is the process of evaluating software at the after the development process and to check whether it meets the customer requirements.
===========================================================================================================================================
Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.

Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.

Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.

501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 

500 (Internal Server Error)

415 (Unsupported Media Type)

412 (Precondition Failed)

404 (Not Found)

401 (Unauthorized)

201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 

301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Ans: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework
Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Examples:
|filename|
|file1|
|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
#18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Below is the syntax of Cucumber Options tag:

@CucumberOptions(features="Features",glue={"StepDefinition"})

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #24) What is the name of the plugin that is used to integrate Eclipse with Cucumber?

Ans: Cucumber Natural Plugin is the plugin that is used to integrate Eclipse with Cucumber.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #30) What is the use of glue property under the Cucumber Options tag?
Ans: Glue property is used to let the Cucumber framework identify the location of step definition files

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import cucumber.api.CucumberOptions;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;
 
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
 features = "Feature"
 ,glue={"stepDefinition"}
 )
 
public class TestRunner {
 
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #28) Should any code be written within the TestRunner class?
Ans: No code should be written under the TestRunner class. It should include the tags @RunWith and @CucumberOptions.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================Q: What is the difference between the QA and software testing?

19. How do you test a product if the requirements are yet to be freezed?
If the required specifications are not available for a product, then a test plan can be created based on the assumptions made about the product. But we should get all assumptions well-documented in the test plan.
===============================================================================================================
22. Is there any difference between retesting and regression testing?
===============================================================================================================
24. What are the different types of functional testing?
Functional testing covers the following types of validation techniques:

Unit testing

41. What is the difference between performance testing and monkey testing?
Performance testing checks the speed, scalability, and/or stability characteristics of a system. Performance is identified with achieving response time, throughput, and resource-utilization levels that meet the performance objectives for a project or a product.

Monkey testing is a technique in software testing where the user tests the application by providing random inputs, checking the behavior of the application (or trying to crash the application).
===============================================================================================================
Q #3) How does Java enable high performance?
Ans: Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. JIT is used to convert the bytecodes into machine readable code.
===============================================================================================================
Q #4) What are the Java IDE’s?
Ans: Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE's of JAVA.
===============================================================================================================
Q #15) What is meant by Interface?
All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
The class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix
===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q:Difference between git commit and git commit-push ?
Basically git commit puts your changes into your local repo, while git push sends your changes to the remote location. git push is used to add commits you have done on the local repository to a remote one - together with git pull

=========================================================================================================================================================
Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

We can handle hidden elements by using javaScript executor 
(JavascriptExecutor(driver)).executeScript("document.getElementsByClassNa me(ElementLocator).click();"); 
==================================================================================================================================

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.
==================================================================================================================================
13) While using click command can you use screen coordinate?

What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.
===========================================================================================================================================
What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

===========================================================================================================================================
What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

The “Same Origin Policy” is introduced for security reason, and it ensures that content of your site will never be accessible by a script from another site.  As per the policy, any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website’s domain.

To avoid “Same Origin Policy” proxy injection method is used, in proxy injection mode the Selenium Server acts as a client configured HTTP proxy , which sits between the browser and application under test and then masks the AUT under a fictional URL

Git latest version - 2.29.2 
Jenkins 2.263


==================================================================================================================================
Different git commands 

1.git --version ---> this will tell the version of the git installed 
2.git commit 
3.git push 
4.git pull
5.git clone 
6.git add  ---> to make the files ready to commit (add all fiels to stage )/ ready to make them commit ---> run git add filename. //saari files add karne ke run git add .
7.git show 
8.git merge 
9.git branch 
10.git status --> this will tll koi untracked file to nahe hai ( these files needs to be add using git add ) :: To check the status ->go to that folder jaha code hai 
Example ==>
C:\Users\e5584133\Desktop\111>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .classpath
        .project
        .settings/
        pom.xml
        src/
        target/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


****Note : untracked file ka color red hoga ***
Once you run command git add -> files get ready for stage ---> the color of the files will change to Green 


11.makig file come from stage/tracked file (green file ) to untracked state (Red file)
cmd 
git rm --cached filename




*****Squence of commands ****
Git status -here the untracked files will be there / tracked files will be green (jo commit ho chuki hai)
Git add --this is used to add the file --to make the files ready to commit (add all fiels to stage )
Git status --green wali tracked hogi ya stage state mein hongi ---red wali means they are untracked 
Git commit ---apne local mein push karna ====> git commit -m "Intial commit" =====> m is used in the command for message
Git log - yeh btaeyga ki kon kon se commit hue hai aapne 
Git push --pushing code to repository

Status codes for API ::

200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.

501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 

500 (Internal Server Error)

415 (Unsupported Media Type)

412 (Precondition Failed)

404 (Not Found)

401 (Unauthorized)

201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 

301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

What is API testing?

API (Application Programming Interface) specifies how some software components should interact with other, in other words it’s a set of functions and procedures that allows the creation of applications which access the features or data of an application or operating system.   Testing of these functions is known as API testing.

API is the middle layer between the presentation (UI) and the database layer. APIs enable communication and data exchange from one software system to another.

There are three separate layers in a typical app: the presentation (or user interface) layer, the business layer, and the database layer for modeling and manipulating data.
API testing is performed at the most critical layer: business, in which business logic processing is carried out and all transactions between the user interface and database layers happen.

	// Clicking on each link
	links.get(i).click();
	// Navigating back to the previous page that stores the links
	driver.navigate().back();
}

===================================================================================================================================
What is desired capabilities?
Desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
desired capabalities are for chrome and for furefox we use firfoxoption
desired capabilities are used for chrome , for firefox we use firefox options 

============================================
Why Variable in the Interface is public static final ?

public: for the accessibility across all the classes, just like the methods present in the interface

static: as interface cannot have an object, the interfaceName.variableName can be used to reference it or directly the variableName in the class implementing it.

final: to make them constants. If 2 classes implement the same interface and you give both of them the right to change the value, conflict will occur in the current value of the var, which is why only one time initialization is permitted.

===================================================================================================================================
Q:Name the superclass in Java.
Java.lang. All different non-primitive are inherited directly or indirectly from this class.
=========================================================================================================================================================
What is an anonymous inner class? How is it different from an inner class?
Any local inner class which has no name is known as an anonymous inner class. Since it doesn’t have any name, it is impossible to create its constructor. It always either extends a class or implements an interface, and is defined and instantiated in a single statement.

A non-static nested class is called an inner class. Inner classes are associated with the objects of the class and they can access all methods and variables of the outer class.
=========================================================================================================================================================
What is a system class?
It is a core class in Java. Since the class is final, we cannot override its behavior through inheritance. Neither can we instantiate this class since it doesn’t provide any public constructors. Hence, all of its methods are static.

Break and Continue diff?

Example break:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if (i == 3)
{

}
System.out.println(i);
}


Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}

=========================================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

=========================================================================================================================================================
Static and Non Static method 

Non Static methods - It can access any static method and any static variable without creating an instance of the class
=========================================================================================================================================================
Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )
public class FailedScenarios {

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q:Difference in hooks and background 

Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in a single feature. A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps. The difference is when it is run. The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your Before Hooks.

Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy.They are typically used for setup and tear down of the environment before and after each scenario.


Use Background only to setup a pre-condition that the user needs to know

===================================================================================================================================
Q11.What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

===================================================================================================================================
14. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.

===================================================================================================================================

UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a series of specific tests which determines whether the product will meet the needs of its users.
User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1

Q:Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

Q:. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

--Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
--Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
--Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
--Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
#18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Using getter and setter method we can access the data.
=======================================================================
5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?
No. System testing should start only if all modules are in place and they work correctly. However, it should be performed before UAT (user acceptance testing).

Ans: Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE's of JAVA.
===============================================================================================================
Q #15) What is meant by Interface?
All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
The class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
===============================================================================================================
Q #17) Difference between Array and Array List.

No index required.

name.add(“book”)
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

==========================================================================================================================================================
Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.


Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

Multiple Window in Selenium ::
getWindowHandle() method return a string value and it returns the Window handle of current focused browser window. 

getWindowHandles() method returns a set of all Window handles of all the browsers that were opened in the session.


// Get current window handle
        String parentWinHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
        System.out.println("Parent window handle: " + parentWinHandle);


//Dealing with Multiple Handlers 
Set<String> winHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
        // Loop through all handles
        for(String handle: winHandles){
            if(!handle.equals(parentWinHandle)){
            driver.switchTo().window(handle);
            Thread.sleep(1000);

Java Packages -contains classes and Interfaces

Finalise --Used with Garbage collector ,method called before GC to run clean up -means to close the resources asscoiated with objects like DB / netwrok connectn 
It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses. 
finalize() method in Java
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.

====

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

===========================================================================================================================================
Q15. Define a Java Class.

Q:Status codes for API ?
200 - OK - It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.Unlike the 204 status code, a 200 response should include a response body.

501 (Not Implemented)-The server either does not recognize the request method, or it cannot fulfill the request. 

500 (Internal Server Error)

415 (Unsupported Media Type)

412 (Precondition Failed)

404 (Not Found)

401 (Unauthorized)

201 Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

204 No Content -The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 

301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Suppose there are 2 @Before and 2 @Aftr methods then how will you manage which before to run firsta nd which later on

Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Difference in hooks and background 

Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in a single feature. A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps. The difference is when it is run. 

================>The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your Before Hooks<===================

Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy.They are typically used for setup and tear down of the environment before and after each scenario.


Use Background only to setup a pre-condition that the user needs to know.

Note : Pehle Hooks chalte hain fir background keyword

Q:Mention why to choose Python over Java in Selenium?

Few points that favor Python over Java to use with Selenium is,

Java programs tend to run slower compared to Python programs.
Java uses traditional braces to start and ends blocks, while Python uses indentation.
Java employs static typing, while Python is dynamically typed.
Python is simpler and more compact compared to Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q: what is desired capability? How is it useful in terms of Selenium?

The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?

Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened
Report: Report the issues to higher level manager
Control: Define the issue management process
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Can we override static methods of a class-No,because static method / variables has the right in their class only.

Answer: The code won’t compile because we havent called the static method
===========================================================================================================================================
What are verification and validation?
Verification is a process of evaluating software at the development phase. It helps you to decide whether the product of a given application satisfies the specified requirements. Validation is the process of evaluating software at the after the development process and to check whether it meets the customer requirements.
===========================================================================================================================================
Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Java static block ?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader. It is used to initialize static variables of the class. Mostly it’s used to create static resources when class is loaded.

         public void tearDown() throws Exception { 
         driver.quit(); 
    } 



===========================================================================================================================================
What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Test(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)
===========================================================================================================================================
Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

How to overcome stale element error ?

one way is to refresh the page 

Second way is by keeping the statement failing in try and in catch mention the exception and then keep the statement which you want to execute 

Example ::
try{
username.sendkeys("ABD");
}
catch(Stateelementexceptione){
username =  driver.findelement(By.Xpath(***));
username.sendkeys("ABD");
}

Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?

The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one
Singletons often control access to resources, such as database connections or sockets.

Example :  you have a license for only one connection for your database or your JDBC driver has trouble with multithreading, the Singleton makes sure that only one connection is made or that only one thread can access the connection at a time.

Creating Singleton class ==>
To design a singleton class:
1.Make constructor as private.
2.Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.

Normal class vs Singleton class: Difference in normal and singleton class in terms of instantiation is that, For normal class we use constructor, whereas for singleton class we use getInstance() method

20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain System.out.println();
--System : is a final class in  java.lang package.As this is final class so this cannot be inherited 
--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Super 
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Public class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  

Public class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
Public void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  i.e black 
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  i.e white
}  
}  


Public class TestSuper1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog dog=new Dog();  
dog.printColor();  
}}

Explain what is assertion in Selenium and what are the types of assertion?
Assertion is used as a  verification point. It verifies that the state of the application conforms to what is expected.  The types of assertion are “assert” , “verify” and “waifFor”. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
Equals - Method while == operator .
equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas . equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects. ... When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.

Q:Selenium webdriver archietecture ?

Selenium Client Library
JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client
Browser Drivers
Browsers

1. Selenium Client Libraries/Language Bindings

Selenium supports multiple libraries such as Java, Ruby, Python, etc. Selenium Developers have developed language bindings to allow Selenium to support multiple languages. If you wish to know more about libraries, kindly refer to the official site for Selenium libraries.

2. JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to transfer data between a server and a client on the web. JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP server. Each BrowserDriver (such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, etc.) has its own HTTP server.

3. Browser Drivers

Each browser contains a separate browser driver. Browser drivers communicate with the respective browser without revealing the internal logic of the browser’s functionality. When a browser driver has received any command then that command will be executed on the respective browser and the response will go back in the form of an HTTP response.

4. Browsers

Selenium supports multiple browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, etc.


Explanation
WebDriver driver  = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");

Once you are ready with your script, you will click on Run to execute the program. Based on the above statements, the Firefox browser will be launched and it will navigate to Edureka website.

Once you click on ‘Run’, every statement in your script will be converted as a URL, with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP. The URL’s will be passed to the Browser Drivers. (In the above code, I have used FirefoxDriver). Here, in this case, the client library (Java) will convert the statements of the script into JSON format and further communicate with the FirefoxDriver. 

Every Browser Driver uses an HTTP server to receive HTTP requests. Once the URL reaches the Browser Driver, then it will pass that request to the real browser over HTTP. Once done, the commands in your Selenium script will be executed on the browser. In the case of Chrome browser, you can write your Selenium script as shown below:

WebDriver driver  = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://www.edureka.co");
If the request is POST request, then there will be an action on the browser. If the request is a GET request then the corresponding response will be generated at the browser end. It will be then sent over HTTP to the browser driver and the Browser Driver over JSON Wire Protocol and sends it to the UI (Eclipse IDE).

74. What is a Defect?
The variation between the actual results and expected results is known as a defect. If a developer finds an issue and corrects it by himself in the development phase then it’s called a defect. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75. What is a Bug?

If testers find any mismatch in the application/system in testing phase then they call it as Bug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76. What is an Error?
We can’t compile or run a program due to a coding mistake in a program. If a developer unable to successfully compile or run a program then they call it as an error. 

77. What is a Failure?
Once the product is deployed and customers find any issues then they call the product as a failure product. After release, if an end user finds an issue then that particular issue is called as a failure. Click here for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) What are the important tasks in Test Planning phase? Important tasks in Test planning phase are: 
i) Understanding and Analyzing the Requirements 
ii) Risk Analysis
iii) Test Strategy Implementation 
iv) Test Estimations (Scope, Time, Resources, Budget etc…) 
v) Team Formation 
vi) Test Plan Documentation 
vii) Configuration Management Planning 
viii) Traceability Matrix documentation 
ix) Define Test Environment Setup

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is bug leakage and bug release? 
Bug Leakage: A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that bug (which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage. 

Bug release: Releasing the software to the Production with some known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included in the release note. In other case, releasing the software to the testing team with some known bugs whose severity and priority is low. These bugs can be removed before releasing to production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Suppose there is a functionality in the application , which has got some changes - now is it nessecary to do complete regression testing .What else can be done in this case ?

Ans - In this case based on the impact this feature has on the other feature , the testing can be done and yes ,no need to do complete regression testing if there is time constaint.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory?
Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is Bucket Testing?
Bucket testing is a method to compare two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is static block?
Java static block is the group of statements that gets executed when the class is loaded into memory by Java ClassLoader.It is used to initialize static variables of the class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Is it possible to write multiple catch blocks under a single try block?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to write several catch blocks under a single try block. However, the approach needs to be from specific to general. Following example demonstrates the same:

public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?

Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened
Report: Report the issues to higher level manager
Control: Define the issue management process

Q:
JRE :software package that provides Java class libraries, along with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.Instrc->BC.
JDK :software development kit to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded, and don't need to download it separately.
JVM : is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.bytecode into native machine readbale  code
JIT : byte code to Instructions and helps to make java a fast language 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Abstract methods in selenium webdriver?

Selenium WebDriver interface has many abstract methods like get(String url), quit(), close(), getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles(), getTitle() etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would you get to the next sibling?
tr/td[@class='user’]/following-sibling::td

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader.

88. What are the different Methodologies in Agile Development Model?

There are currently seven different agile methodologies that I am aware of:

Extreme Programming (XP)
Scrum
Lean Software Development
Feature-Driven Development
Agile Unified Process
Crystal
Dynamic Systems Development Model (DSDM)



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is data encapsulation and what's its significance?

Ans: Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit.
Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.

Advantage - no one can our class data , the outside class can use the variables (private) whihc we have made setter and getter 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is default switch case? Give example.

Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?

Ans: Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn't have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) While using click command can you use screen coordinate? 
To click on specific part of element, you would need to use clickAT command.  ClickAt command accepts element locator and x, y co-ordinates as arguments- clickAt (locator, cordString)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is same origin policy? How you can avoid same origin policy?

The “Same Origin Policy” is introduced for security reason, and it ensures that content of your site will never be accessible by a script from another site.  As per the policy, any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website’s domain.

To avoid “Same Origin Policy” proxy injection method is used, in proxy injection mode the Selenium Server acts as a client configured HTTP proxy , which sits between the browser and application under test and then masks the AUT under a fictional URL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is forbidden error?
The 403 Forbidden error is an HTTP status code which means that accessing the page or resource you were trying to reach is absolutely forbidden for some reason.
Rwasons :
An empty website directory
No index page

What is JavaScriptExecutor and in which cases JavaScriptExecutor will help in Selenium automation?
In general, we click on an element using click() method in Selenium.

For example:

driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
1
driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
Sometimes web controls don’t react well against selenium commands and we may face issues with the above statement (click()). To overcome such kind of situation, we use JavaScriptExecutor interface.

1. To type Text in Selenium WebDriver without using sendKeys() method
2. To click a Button in Selenium WebDriver using JavaScript
3. To handle Checkbox
4. To generate Alert Pop window in selenium
5. To refresh browser window using Javascript
6. To get innertext of the entire webpage in Selenium
7. To get the Title of our webpage
8. To get the domain
9. To get the URL of a webpage
10. To perform Scroll on an application using  Selenium

int numberOfElements=elements.size();

for(int i=0;i<numberOfElements;i++){
    elements=driver.findElements(By.xpath(".//*[starts-with(@id,'ct100_cPH_rptrDisplayRecords')]"));
    elements.get(i).click();
    //click edit button and manage the popup
    .........
    .........
    // Uncomment below code if the selection of the check box is not automatically cleared on closing the popup
    /* elements=driver.findElements(By.xpath(".//*[starts-with(@id,'ct100_cPH_rptrDisplayRecords')]"));
    elements.get(i).click(); */
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Is it possible to interact with hidden elements using WebDriver?
Selenium has been specifically written to NOT allow interaction with hidden elements. ... However, Selenium does allow you to execute Javascript within the context of an element, so you could write Javascript to perform the click event even if it is hidden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is WebElement an interface or a class -----Interface , The WebElement interface is implemented by AndroidWebElement, HtmlUnitWebElement, or RemoteWebElement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:What is the difference between dragAndDrop() and dragAndDropBy()?
The dragAndDrop() method is similar to dragAndDropBy() method. The only difference between them is that we move the cursor to WebElement by an offset in dragAndDropBy() method, whereas, in dragAndDrop() method, we directly move the cursor on target WebElement. ...

Q:what is Iterator in java?--An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Can we declare a final global variable and use it without initializing it? -----No

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:Before and Before Class

@BeforeClass :: Execute before all test methods of the class are executed.Used with static method.                                                 ¦              ¦             ¦
¦ For example, This method could contain some initialization code 

@Before :Execute before each test method. Used with non-static method.

Please explain the difference between String and String Buffer.
Answer: String variables are stored in a constant string pool. With the change in the string reference, it becomes impossible to delete the old value. For example, if a string has stored a value “Old” then adding the new value “New” will not delete the old value. It will still be there, however, in a dormant state. In a String Buffer, values are stored in a stack. With the change in the string reference, the new value replaces the older value.

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",

              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
            "json:target/cucumber.json"}
  )

===========================================================================================================================================
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Ans: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Ans: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language such as Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework
Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.

Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Examples:
|filename|
|file1|
|file2|
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Ans: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Ans: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.
===========================================================================================================================================
#18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Ans: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Q #15) What is meant by Interface?
All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
The class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
===============================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.
===============================================================================================================
26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides. At that time the presence of another defect in the system is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.
===============================================================================================================
39. What is the difference between Test matrix and Traceability matrix?
Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix
===============================================================================================================
52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?
In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.
===============================================================================================================
55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the code from being executed
===============================================================================================================
59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?
Code Walk Through is the informal analysis of the program source code to find defects and verify coding techniques
===============================================================================================================
70. Why we use decision tables?s
The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table
===============================================================================================================
80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?
Testing technique: – Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: – Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient to conduct testing

Can main() method in Java can return any data - NO ,as it is void ---Public Static Void main [String(arg{})]
==========================================================================================================================================================
--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.

11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
===========================================================================================================================================
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. 
===================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

--Static Keyword 
static member(block,variable,method,nested class)-->When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object..

Static Variables :: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Exmaple ::
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  


Static Method : best example is Main method 
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
Static nested classes : We can not declare top-level class with a static modifier, but can declare nested classes as static.

All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================
What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? 
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.

Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.

1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.

1. What is the use of TestNG/Junit ?
2. What is parameterized testing?
3. How can u achieve parameterized testing using TestNG?
With the help of 2 annotations @Parameters and @Dataprovider.
4. Can you map test method names in XML file along with class names?
Yes, we can do it please see below ex:
<classes>
<class name="test.IndividualMethodsTest">
<methods>
<include name="testMethod" />
</methods>
</class>
</classes>
5. Sequence of execution of below annotations:
@Test
@BeforeGroups
@AfterGroups
@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass

6. What is Yaml file?
TestNG supports YAML as an alternate way of specifying your suite file.You might find the YAML file format easier to read and to maintain. YAML files are also recognized by the TestNG Eclipse plug-in. 
7. How will you execute only selected test methods in particular Test class?
8. How do you fail test cases in TestNg?
9. Can we execute test cases parallely in TestNg?
10. How can we control the order of test method invocation?
We need to create Dependency.
TestNG allows you to specify dependencies either with annotations or in XML.: 
You can use the attributes dependsOnMethods or dependsOnGroups, found on the @Test annotation.
Alternatively, you can specify your group dependencies in the testng.xml file. You use the <dependencies> tag to achieve this: 
11. How can you make sure test methods which are run in a certain order doesn't really depend on the success of others ?
By adding "alwaysRun=true" in your @Test annotation.

Example: With the help of Scanner class, we have to take five inputs(u can take any random number) Like: 5, 45, 50, 52, 91
Now you have to print the missing numbers between all the numbers. Like 6 to 44 than 46 to 49 than 51 than 53 to 90.
But if user entered the number not in any order Like: 5, 2, 98, 50, 16
so first you have to sort it in some order & than print the missing numbers

What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================
18. How negative testing is useful?
Negative testing ensures that your application can gracefully handle invalid input or unexpected user behavior. ... The purpose of negative testing is to detect such situations and prevent applications from crashing.
===============================================================================
What is forbidden error?
The 403 Forbidden error is an HTTP status code which means that accessing the page or resource you were trying to reach is absolutely forbidden for some reason.

Reasons :
An empty website directory
No index page
Permission / Ownership error
===============================================================================
What are the difference between primitive and derived data types?
Derived -Derived data type : These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. These include Arrays, Structures, Class, Union, Enumeration, Pointers etc.
Primitive/Fundamental data type : Each variable in C/C++ has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it.

Oracle & CTS

1) what is testing? Different types of testing.
Ans- Testing- its an step by step procedure to verify the software/application's each functionality whether its working as per requirement or not.
Types- whitebox(developer), blackbox(TE), greybox(TE), integration, system, UAT.
2) why we do automation testing?
Ans- Reasons- 
	Manual testing of all work flows, all fields, all negative scenarios is time and cost consuming.
	It is difficult to test for multi lingual sites manually.
	Automation does not require human intervention. We can run automated test unattended(Overnight).
	Automation increases speed of test execution.
	Automation helps increase test coverage.
	Manual testing can become boring and hence error prone.

3) explain me about ur project and it's architecture.
Ans- explains urs.
4) what is testing strategy?
Ans- A Test Strategy document is a high level document and normally developed by project manager. This document defines “Software Testing Approach” to achieve testing objectives. The Test Strategy is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification document.

The Test Strategy document is a static document meaning that it is not updated too often. It sets the standards for testing processes and activities and other documents such as the Test Plan draws its contents from those standards set in the Test Strategy Document.
5) what is test plan document and explain the contents briefly.
Ans- The Test Plan document is derived from the Product Description, Software Requirement Specification SRS, or Use Case Documents.
The Test Plan document is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Test Manager and the focus of the document is to describe what to test, how to test, when to test and who will do what test.
6) what is regression testing, how did u perform in your project?
Ans- Re-executing the old TC's in the new release to make sure that changes has not affected the existing features is called as regression testing. Explain as per ur proj.
7) how was QC useful in testing process in your project to log & track defects?
Ans- It is not used in my project. Explain if it is used in urs.

8) what are the different types of testing life cycle models, which type of testing model does your project follow?have you worked in agile methodology in any of your project?
Ans- Types- Waterfall, Spiral/Iterative/Cycle, Prototype Model, Agile.
My project is using Agile methodology.
9) SQL query to find out 4th maximum salary.
Ans- SELECT SALARY FROM TABLE
WHERE SALARY IN                    
(SELECT SALARY FROM TABLE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC               
FETCH FIRST 4 ROWS ONLY)          
ORDER BY SALARY ASC                
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY           
10) write the self join query in order to find the department of the manager of a manager whose department is ABC.
Ans- Employee
emp mngr dept
A       B    ABC
B       D    HR
D       E    Dir

select MOM.dept from Employee E
join Employee M
on E.mngr = M.emp
join Employee MOM
on M.mngr = MOM.emp;

11) different types of joins, simple SQL queries like select, update etc.
Ans- inner join, left join, right join, full join.
12) simple unix commands to list a file, find all files which contains the desired word say your name in them.
Ans- Unix I am not sure.
13) what is your role in your project, how do you overcome hurdles that you might face when your immediate senior/manager is not present to attend a meeting with client and you have an important thing like an application crash occurs during testing, how do u handle such circumstances?
Ans- explain urs.
14) explain java in layman terms if I don't understand any technical stuffs like private, class or object..
Ans- Java is a programming language which is plateform independent i.e. we can compile code in one machine and can run in another machine with different OS. We can develop different kind of applications using java.
15) explain automation architecture and how what kind of architecture was in your project an explain it.
Ans- explain ur framework.
16) why do we use interfaces? Why is interface concept present when something could be achieved using classes or abstract classes?
Ans- to achieve 100% abstraction and standardization. By using classes and abstract classes we can't achieve 100% abstraction bcoz loop holes are there.

17) tell the use of abstract classes over interfaces, and how are interfaces built in terms of methods declared and variables within it..?
Ans- If the functionality you are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface. Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing common functionality to unrelated classes.
Interfaces can have only incomplete methods and all methods will be non-static and public. Variables declared inside interfaces will always be final, static and should be initialized.

18) questions on collections like how do you do sorting using collections? 
Ans- Collections.sort(List arg).

19)Giving an example, he asked me to chose which collection would I chose for that particular scenario.. Like getwindowhandles returns set, but can I also make use of list or any other collection? Similar questions..
Ans- No we can't use List.

19) testNG and how you could initiate your automation script..
Ans-TestNG is a unit Testing tool/Framework; We can run TestNG class directly or through TestNG Suite(xml)  we can also integrate with other tool like ANT, Maven, Jenkins

20) how to connect to database using selenium, it's requirements for connection and commands for connection.
Ans-using JDBC.
Example
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student","root","");
	Driver a = DriverManager.getDriver("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
	ResultSet r = con.createStatement().executeQuery("select * from student");
	int cc=r.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
	
	while(r.next())
	{for (int i=1;i<cc;i++)
		{
		System.out.println(r.getString(i));
		}
	}
	r.close();
	con.close();


 Please refer class notes for details.

21) differences between overloading and overriding, what is polymorphism, what is abstraction and write a program which shows me something which I understand about these concepts.
Ans- overloading – developing the same method with different arg type.
Overriding- developing the methods with same method signature but different method body. Inheritace must for overriding.
Polymorphism- an object showing different behaviour at different stages of development is known as Polymorphism.
Abstraction- its like hiding the implementations of the methods.
ex- class A{
	void test1(){
		System.out.println(“test1 of A”);
	}	
} 
class B extends A{
	void test1(){
		System.out.println(“test1 of B”);
	}
}
class C extends B{
	void sample(A  a){
		System.out.println(“sample method”);
		a.test1();
	}
}
class D{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		C c1 = new C();
		c1.sample(new A());
		c1.sample(new B());
		c1.test1();
	}
}
output of this program - 
A
B
B




22) write a program to check if the given input is palindrome or not by taking input from user at runtime.
Ans- class Palindrome{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int a = n;
		int palindrome =0;
		int r = 0;
		while(n>0){
			r = n%10;
			n = n/10;
			palindrome = palindrome*10 + r;
		}
		if(palindrome==a){
			System.out.println(a+” number is palindrome.”);
		}else{
			System.out.println(a+” number is not palindrome.”);
		}
	}
}
23) what is advantages of using testng, why can't we run selenium code directly?
Ans- can have 3kinds of report, parallel execution, skip a particular tc, change the order of execution, lots of annotaions, can execute without main method etc.. 
It is not necessary to use testng.xml to run the selenium code. You can directly run your selenium code. In order to create a test suite and run seperate test cases, you need some framework which drive the automation. Here testng.xml can be called as "driver" which drives several test cases automated using selenium code.

24) have you worked on Jenkins? What is advantages of it? What if developer does not use Jenkins, but testing team has been asked to use it? Can you do so without developer creating the build in Jenkins, your automation code can start?
Ans- Jenkins is a continues integration  tool; we use it to start the framework execution automatically as soon as the build is received from dev team ; If Dev team is not using Jenkins still testing team can use it where we can schedule the framework execution time or we can write customized script which can trigger the Frame Work 

25)disadvantages and advantages of selenium, where can all I not use selenium?
Ans- 
Disadvantages- can't automate windows based application, Cant Handle Tab Browseres ,Cant Handle Existing Browser; Cant Hanled Flex/Flash application etc.
Advantages- Free,Open Source, Platform independed;Supports All Browsers

26) given just 2days and you have like 100 testcases to manually execute and your colleague is on long leave, what will you do? U think this situation can occur real time? Can u execute all testcases alone within deadlines?
Ans- depends on the complexity of the application, if the each tc won't take much time then we can execute 100 tc. If it's taking much time in that case we will execute the test case's on the priority and severity basis. Like new test cases should be executed and if time remain then we will try to execute as many as we can from the existing tcs.

27) what is the code to find the active element in the web page?
Ans- List<WebElement> allElements = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//*"));
		for(int i=0;i<allElements.size();i++)
		{
			WebElement e=allElements.get(i);
			
			if(e.isEnabled())
			{	
			System.out.println(e.getTagName());
			}
		}

28) write a selenium program to verify that the navigation of the web page is landing at the correct URL at the next page..
Ans- driver.fiindElement(By.xpath(“xpath of anylink which u wan to check”)).click();
         String expURL = “give expected url”;
         String act = driver.getCurrentUrl();
         Assert.assertEquals(act,exp);

29) write a code to make use of assert if my username is incorrect.
Ans- try{
		Assert.assertEquals(actUserName),expUserName) 
	}catch(Exception e){
		Syste.out.println(“name is invalid”);
	}
30) what is the skeleton of testng.xml? What all does/can it contain?
Ans- 
suite 
 |- test
    |-classes
        |- class

Ans- FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(“path of file”);
	Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(fis);
	String info = wb.getSheet(“SheetName”).getRow(rownum).getCell(cellNum).getStringCellValue();
	Reporter.log(info, true);

33) how confident are you in manual testing,selenium,java?
Ans- out of 10- manual – 7, selenium-9, and java – 9.

34) code to write the usage of actions class with an example, usage of select class
Ans- ex- Actions act = new Actions(driver); 
	  act.moveToElement(webElement).perform();

Select sel = new Select(WebElement);
sel.selectByValue("v");

35) switching between the two browsers(parent and child), popup differences and identification.
Ans- Iterator<String> it = driver.getWindowHandles().iterator();
	String parent = it.next();
	String child = it.next();
	driver.switchTo().window(child);
	driver.switchTo().window(parent);

Ans- xpath(), tagName(), className(), linkText(), partialLinkText(), cssSelector(), id(), name().
4.What is the command to open the Firefox Browser and URL?
Ans- WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get(“url”); or driver.navigate().to(“url”);
5.What is Hybrid Framework?
Ans- Its is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.
6.What is the difference between Hybrid Framework and Function driven Framework?
Ans- In Function driven fw,we use the same functions/methods again and again by calling them in different modules. Hybrid driven framework is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.

Q:Differnce in findBy , findBys and FindAll

@FindBys : When the required WebElement objects need to match all of the given criteria use @FindBys annotation

@FindAll : When required WebElement objects need to match at least one of the given criteria use @FindAll annotation

Usage:

@FindBys( {
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
} )
private List<WebElement> elementsWithBoth_class1ANDclass2;
Here List elementsWithBothclass1ANDclass2 will contain any WebElement which satisfies both criteria.

@FindAll({
   @FindBy(className = "class1")
   @FindBy(className = "class2")
})
private List<WebElement> elementsWithEither_class1ORclass2  
Here List elementsWithEither_class1ORclass2 will contain all those WebElement that satisfies any one of the criteria.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is a deferred bug 
The bug, changed to deferred state means the bug is expected to be fixed in next releases. ... If the tester feels that the bug no longer exists in the software, tester changes the status of the bug to “closed”. 

===============================================================================
路        Drop vs truncate
DROP command is used to remove table definition and its contents. Whereas the TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table. ... DROP is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command. Whereas the TRUNCATE is also a DDL(Data Definition Language) command.

DROP TABLE table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name; 

===============================================================================
路        What is join 
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

===============================================================================
Q:what is difference b/w comparable and comparator?

Compare :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2.Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
3.Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.

Comparator :
1.we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2.Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3.Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

48. How to check which option in the dropdown is selected?
Answer: Using the isSelected() method we can check the state of a dropdown’s option.
Select countriesDropDown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(“countries”)));
dropdown.selectByVisibleText(“India”);
//returns true or false value
System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.id(“India”)).isSelected());

        int temp = 0;    
            
        
        //Sort the array in ascending order    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            for (int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {     
               if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {    
                   temp = arr[i];    
                   arr[i] = arr[j];    
                   arr[j] = temp;    
               }     
            }

Q: Difference between findelement and findelements ?

Ans - when no element is found in case of findelement it will throw error - no such element found , however in case of findelements it will not throw any error and will return 0.
===============================================================================
What if the main() method is declared as private?

The program compiles properly but at runtime it will give "main() method not public." message.
===============================================================================
What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main() method?

Program compiles. But at runtime throws an error "NoSuchMethodError".
===============================================================================
What if I do not provide the String array as the argument to the method?
Program compiles but throws a runtime error "NoSuchMethodError".

===============================================================================
What is the first argument of the String array in main() method?

The String array is empty. It does not have any element.
===============================================================================
What environment variables do I need to set on my machine in order to be able to run Java programs?

CLASSPATH and PATH are the two variables.

===============================================================================
Can an application have multiple classes having main() method?

Yes it is possible. While starting the application we mention the class name to be run. The JVM will look for the Main method only in the class whose name you have mentioned.
===============================================================================
Do I need to import java.lang package any time? Why ?

No. It is by default loaded internally by the JVM.

===============================================================================
Are the imports checked for validity at compile time? Example: will the code containing an import such as java.lang.ABCD compile?

Yes the imports are checked for the semantic validity at compile time. The code containing above line of import will not compile
===============================================================================
What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?
In declaration we just mention the type of the variable and it's name. We do not initialize it. But defining means declaration + initialization.

Example: String s; is just a declaration while String s = new String ("abcd"); Or String s = "abcd"; are both definitions.
===============================================================================
What type of parameter passing does Java support?

In Java the arguments are always passed by value.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q: grouping in testNG 

Ans 
Suppose there are 3 methods 

@Test(groups="regression")
public void M1(){
system.out.printLn("M1");
}

@Test(groups="smoke")
public void M2(){
system.out.printLn("M2");
}


@Test(groups="smoke" , "regression")
public void M3(){
system.out.printLn("M3");
}

Now you want to run particular group test cases

20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −

Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.

Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.


example -

 //Include all db values for each text box in an array


            Object[] valueArray = new Object[8] { dbname, dbvendorid, dbcounty, dbstate,
                                                  dbemail, dbphone, dbstatus, dblegacynumber };

            //Enter value, search, and validate for each text box
            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
            {
                Driver.SendKey(elementArray[i], valueArray[i].ToString(), "Search for a value in search panel");
                ClickOnSearch();
                ValidSearchPanelCheck();

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.


===============================================================================================================================================
--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?

===================================================================================================================================
Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

==============================================================================
Q:Use of OOPs in framework ?polmor /encapsulatin/inheritance/abstraction
Ans -
ABSTRACTION
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. We utilize these locators in tests but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.

Interface 
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); we are initializing Firefox browser using Selenium WebDriver. It means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface (WebDriver) and creating an Object. Here WebDriver is an Interface as mentioned earlier and FirefoxDriver is a class.

INHERITANCE
We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc., in the Base Class.

METHOD OVERLOADING
We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading

ENCAPSULATION
All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.


WEB ELEMENT:
Web element is an interface used to identify the elements in a web page.

WEBDRIVER:
WebDriver is an interface used to launch different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.,

FIND BY:
FindBy is an annotation used in Page Object Model design pattern to identify the elements.

FIND ELEMENT:
Find Element is a method in POM to identify the elements in a web page.

==============================================================================
What are the types of WebDriver APIs available in Selenium?
Firefox Driver
Gecko Driver
InternetExplorer Driver
Chrome Driver
HTMLUnit Driver
Opera Driver
Safari Driver
Android Driver
iPhone Driver
EventFiringWebDriver

==============================================================================
Is the FirefoxDriver a Class or an Interface? 
FirefoxDriver is a Java class, and it implements the WebDriver interface.
==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
==============================================================================
How can we handle windows based pop up?
Selenium doesn’t support windows based applications. It is an automation testing tool which supports only web application testing. We could handle windows based popups in Selenium using some third party tools such as AutoIT, Robot class etc.

===========================================================================================================================================
==Q: How will you handle dynamic elements in selenium ?

Ans - Use regular expression like starts-with , ends-with , contains 

Dynamic elements are web elements which have identifiers that are dynamically generated during run time. Dynamic identifiers could be for any web element of the page but normally used for buttons, text fields and buttons.

Let us take an example of a button whose ID is in the following format…

// Dynamic Element Locators
<button id="Submit-901" />
<button id="Submit-902" />
<button id="Submit-903" />

 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");

============================================================================
--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

--Question: Could you draw a comparison between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array necessitates for giving the size during the time of declaration, while an array list doesn't necessarily require size as it changes size dynamically. To put an object into an array, there is the need to specify the index. However, no such requirement is in place for an array list. While an array list is parameterized, an array is not parameterized.

What is JavaScriptExecutor and in which cases JavaScriptExecutor will help in Selenium automation?
In general, we click on an element using click() method in Selenium.

For example:

1
driver.findElement(By.id("Id Value")).click();
Sometimes web controls don’t react well against selenium commands and we may face issues with the above statement (click()). To overcome such kind of situation, we use JavaScriptExecutor interface.

1. To type Text in Selenium WebDriver without using sendKeys() method
2. To click a Button in Selenium WebDriver using JavaScript
3. To handle Checkbox
4. To generate Alert Pop window in selenium
5. To refresh browser window using Javascript
6. To get innertext of the entire webpage in Selenium
7. To get the Title of our webpage
8. To get the domain
9. To get the URL of a webpage

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

How many parameters do you have to meet for Selenium to pass a test? What are these parameters?
In total, there are four conditions (parameters) for Selenium to pass a test. These are as follows: URL, host, browser and port number.

===========================================================================================================================================
Can we override static methods of a class-No,because static method / variables has the right in their class only.
===========================================================================================================================================
Can we override Non static methods of a class-Yes
===========================================================================================================================================
WHy Java is platform independent ?-yes , code written on any platform can run independently on any platform 
===========================================================================================================================================
Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented? No , because java uses primitive data types (int,byte, - which are not objects -hence 100% Object-orientation not there
============================================================================
Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element. 
===============================================================================		
Q:Methods available in Select class in selenium

Q:Data Table in cucumber

When("^User enters Credentials to LogIn$")
 public void user_enters_testuser__and_Test(DataTable table) throws Throwable {
 List<List<String>> data = table.raw();
 driver.findElement(By.id("log")).sendKeys(data.get(0).get(0)); 
     driver.findElement(By.id("pwd")).sendKeys(data.get(0).get(1));
     driver.findElement(By.id("login")).click();}

==============================================================================
Q:What is API, where it is being used---there are 3 layes -UI - Business - DB .API works on middle layer(Business ).User sends the requests and get the response .
===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Can you make the constructor of a class static?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java, If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur. In general, static means class level.

=============================================================================
Q:What are the different plugins used for Maven? And it’s used?

prepare 
validate 
test 
compile 
package 
install 
deploy
clean
============================================================================
Can we declare the main method of our class as private?

Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?

Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?

Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q50. What's the default access specifier for variables and methods of a class?

Ans: Default access specifier for variables and method is package protected i.e variables and class is available to any other class but in the same package,not outside the package.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q52. How can we restrict inheritance for a class so that no class can be inherited from it?

Ans: If we want a class not to be extended further by any class, we can use the keyword Final with the class name.

In the following example, Stone class is Final and can't be extend

public Final Class Stone {
	// Class methods and Variables
}

===========================================================================================================================================
Q:Write progm for 
*
**
***
****
*****

public static void main(string[] args){

for(int i=0;i>=0;i++){
for(int j=0;j>=i;j++){
system.out.printLn(" " +*);


}
===============================================================================		
Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Ans: Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. We can apply different methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q57. Which types of exceptions are caught at compile time?

Ans: Checked exceptions can be caught at the time of program compilation. Checked exceptions must be handled by using try catch block in the code in order to successfully compile the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q61. A person says that he compiled a java class successfully without even having a main method in it? Is it possible?

Ans: main method is an entry point of Java class and is required for execution of the program however; a class gets compiled successfully even if it doesn't have a main method. It can't be run though.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q63. What are the two environment variables that must be set in order to run any Java programs?

Ans: Java programs can be executed in a machine only once following two environment variables have been properly set:

PATH variable
CLASSPATH variable

Path --
Once you installed Java on your machine, it is required to Set the PATH environment variable to conveniently run the executable (javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command, such as:

ClassPath -
it is speciifc to java 
===========================================================================================================================================
Q64. Can variables be used in Java without initialization?
Ans: In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn't compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q65. Can a class in Java be inherited from more than one class?
Ans: In Java, a class can be derived from only one class and not from multiple classes. Multiple inheritances is not supported by Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q66. Can a constructor have different name than a Class name in Java?

Ans: Constructor in Java must have same name as the class name and if the name is different, it doesn't act as a constructor and compiler thinks of it as a normal method.

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?
A regular expression is a special text string used for describing a search pattern. In Selenium IDE regular expression can be used with the keyword- regexp: as a prefix to the value and patterns needs to be included for the expected values.

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

Core Java Interview Questions
How many methods are there in object class?
Ans: 11 methods, below is the list

protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException – Creates and returns a copy of this object.
Public boolean equals(Object obj) – Indicates whether some other object is “equal to” this one.
Protected void finalize() throws Throwable – Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.
public final Class getClass() – Returns the runtime class of an object.
public int hashCode() – Returns a hash code value for the object.
Public final void notify() – Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object’s monitor.
Public final void notifyAll() – Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object’s monitor.
Public String toString() – Returns a string representation of the object.
Public final void wait() – Causes current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object.
public final void wait(long timeout)
public final void wait(long timeout, int Nanos)
Hashcode method return type?
Ans: integer

what is the finalize method and when it use?
Ans: Garbage collection, it executed before garbage collector runs.

What is equals methods?
Ans: it is used in 2 places, one is a string class, and another is an object class. In string class, it is overridden. In object class, it checks the addresses, and in string class, it checks the contents.

What is the difference between equal and hashcode?
Ans: hashcode can be the same; it is used internally to find out the uniqueness of an object.
Kiran — 89
Naikr — 89
suppose k=23,i=4
Then both Kiran and Naikr have the same hashcode, but both are not the same. But if equals return same, then there must be the same hashcode.

Core Java OOPS Interview Questions

is it compulsory to write body in a method?
Ans: no, ex-abstract class, interface

why do we need to learn encapsulation?
Ans: binding data variables and method in a single unit is called encapsulation. We are using encapsulation to protect our class from others so that others can not extract our class. Her variables should be private and method some time public so that our requirement solved properly.

Difference between encapsulation and abstraction?
Ans: in abstraction, we expose only the required things. But in encapsulation, we are binding the data properly.

What is polymorphism?
Ans: behaving differently at different time by the same entity. It can achieve in 2 ways. Overloading and overriding. in overloading this happens and in overriding this happen.

Why are you using overriding?
Ans: To change the implementation of the parent class.

Why we use interface?
Ans: if we want 100% abstraction then we should go with an interface. To maintain standards.

Do you need to implement all methods of interface?
Ans: if you don’t want to implement all methods, then you have to make that class as abstract.

What is the use of an abstract class?
Ans: if you want to implement or expose some methods and don’t want to implement some methods then go for abstract class

List l=new ArrayList(); and ArrayList al=new ArrayList(); which is good and why ?
Ans: List l=new ArrayList() is good.

what is the difference between final and static?
Ans: in final, the value can not be changed, but in static, you can change the value.

What is difference between JDK,JRE and JVM?
Ans:
JVM: JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine, it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent).
JRE: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM.
JDK: JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?
Ans: Many types:

Class(Method) Area
Heap
Stack
Program Counter Register
Native Method Stack
What is JIT compiler?
Ans: Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.

What is a platform?
Ans: A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides the software-based platform.

What is the main difference between the Java platform and other platforms?
Ans: The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it’s a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:

Runtime Environment
API(Application Programming Interface)
What gives Java its ‘write once and run anywhere’ nature?
Ans: The bytecode. Java is compiled to be a bytecode which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This bytecode is not platform specific and hence can be fed to any platform.

What is classloader?
Ans: The classloader is a subsystem of JVM that is used to load classes and interfaces. There are many types of classloaders, e.g. Bootstrap classloader, Extension classloader, System classloader, Plugin classloader etc.

Is Empty .java file name a valid source file name?
Ans: Yes, save your java file by .java only, compile it by javac .java and run by java your class name. Let’s take a simple example:

//save by .java only
class A{
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Hello java");
}
}
//compile by javac .java
//run by java A
compile it by javac .java
Ans: run it by java A

If I don’t provide any arguments on the command line, then the String array of Main method will be empty or null?
Ans: It is empty. But not null.

What if I write static public void instead of the public static void?
Ans: Program compiles and runs properly.

What is the default value of the local variables?
Ans: The local variables are not initialized to any default value, neither primitives nor object references.

What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?
Ans: Object-based programming languages follow all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. Examples of object-based programming languages are JavaScript, VBScript etc.

What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable?
Ans: The object references are all initialized to null in Java.

What is a constructor?
Ans: Constructor is just like a method that is used to initialize the state of an object. It is invoked at the time of object creation.

What is the purpose of a default constructor?
Ans: The default constructor provides the default values for the objects. The java compiler creates a default constructor only if there is no constructor in the class.

Does constructor return any value?
Ans: yes, that is a current instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).

Is constructor inherited?
Ans: No, the constructor is not inherited.

Can you make a constructor final?
Ans: No, constructor can’t be final.

What is a static variable?
Ans: static variable is used to refer the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object), e.g. company name of employees, college name of students etc. static variable gets memory only once in a class area at the time of class loading.

What is the static method?
Ans: A static method belongs to the class rather than an object of a class. A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class. the static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

Why is the main method static?
Ans: because the object is not required to call the static method if It were a non-static method, JVM creates the object first then call the main() method that will lead to the problem of extra memory allocation.

What is a static block?
Ans: Is used to initialize the static data member. It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.

Can we execute a program without main() method?
Ans: Yes, one of the ways is a static block.

What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method?
Ans: Program compiles. But at runtime throws an error “NoSuchMethodError”.

What is the difference between static (class) method and instance method?
Ans: static or class method instance method

Static Method	Instance Method
A method, i.e. declared as static is known as a static method.	A method, i.e. not declared as static, is known as an instance method.
The object is not required to call the static method.	The object is required to call instance methods.
Non-static (instance) members cannot be accessed in a static context (static method, static block, and static nested class) directly.	Static and non-static variables can be accessed in instance methods.
For example: public static int cube(int n){ return n*n*n;}	For example: public void msg(){…}.
What is this in java?
Ans: It is a keyword that that refers to the current object.

What is Inheritance?
Ans: Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of another object in another class. It represents the IS-A relationship. It is used for Code Reusability and Method Overriding.

Which class is the superclass of every class?
Ans: Object class.

Why are multiple inheritances not supported in java?
Ans: To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritances are not supported in java in case of class.

What is composition?
Ans: Holding the reference of the other class within some other class is known as composition.

What is the difference between aggregation and composition?
Ans: Aggregation represents a weak relationship, whereas composition represents a strong relationship. For example, the bike has an indicator (aggregation), but the bike has an engine (composition).

Why does Java not support pointers?
Ans: Pointer is a variable that refers to the memory address. They are not used in Java because they are unsafe(unsecured) and complex to understand.

What is super in java?
Ans: It is a keyword that refers to the immediate parent class object.

Can you use this() and super() both in a constructor?
Ans: No. Because super() or this() must be the first statement.

What is object cloning?
Ans: The object cloning is used to create the exact copy of an object.

What is method overloading?
Ans: If a class have multiple methods by the same name but different parameters, it is known as Method Overloading. It increases the readability of the program.

Why is method overloading not possible by changing the return type in java?
Ans: Because of ambiguity.

Can we overload the main() method?
Ans: Yes, You can have many main() methods in a class by overloading the main method.

What is method overriding:
Ans: If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class, it is known as Method Overriding. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to provide the specific implementation of the method.

Can we override the static method?
Ans: No, you can’t override the static method because they are the part of class not object.

Why can we not override static method?
Ans: It is because the static method is the part of a class and it is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object and static gets memory in the class area, and instance gets memory in a heap.

Can we override the overloaded method?
Ans: Yes.

Difference between method Overloading and Overriding.
Ans:

Method Overloading	Method Overriding
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.	Method overriding provides the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by its superclass.
Method overloading occurs within the class.	Method overriding occurs in two classes that have an IS-A relationship.
In this case, a parameter must be different.	In this case, a parameter must be the same.
What is the final variable?
Ans: If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of a final variable(It will be constant).

What is the final method?
Ans: Final methods can’t be overridden.

What is the final class?
Ans: Final class can’t be inherited.

What is the final blank variable?
Ans: A final variable, not initialized at the time of declaration, is known as a final blank variable.

Can we initialize the final blank variable?
Ans: Yes, only in the constructor if it is non-static. If it is static blank final variable, it can be initialized only in the static block.

Can you declare the main method as final?
Ans: Yes, such as public static final void main(String[] args){}.

What is Runtime Polymorphism?
Ans: Runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time.
In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

Can you achieve Runtime Polymorphism by data members?
Ans: No.

What is the difference between static binding and dynamic binding?
Ans: In case of a static binding type of object is determined at compile time whereas in a dynamic binding type of object is determined at runtime.

What is abstraction?
Ans: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
Ans: Abstraction hides the implementation details, whereas encapsulation wraps code and data into a single unit.

What is an abstract class?
Ans: A class that is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It needs to be extended, and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Can there be any abstract method without an abstract class?
Ans: No, if there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Can you use abstract and final both with a method?
Ans: No, because the abstract method needs to be overridden, whereas you can’t override a final method.

Is it possible to instantiate the abstract class?
Ans: No, the abstract class can never be instantiated.

What is an interface?
Ans: Interface is a blueprint for a class that has static constants and abstract methods. It can be used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritances.

Can you declare an interface method static?
Ans: No, because methods of an interface are abstract by default, and static and abstract keywords can’t be used together.

Can an Interface be final?
Ans: No, because another class provides its implementation.

What is marker interface?
Ans: An interface that has no data member and method is known as a marker interface. For example, Serializable, Cloneable etc.

What is the difference between abstract class and interface?


Can we define private and protected modifiers for variables in interfaces?
Ans: No, they are implicitly public.

When can an object reference be cast to an interface reference?
Ans: An object reference can be cast to an interface reference when the object implements the referenced interface.

What is a package?
Ans: A package is a group of similar type of classes interfaces and sub-packages. It provides access protection and removes naming collision.

Do I need to import java?lang package any time? Why?
Ans: No. It is by default loaded internally by the JVM.

Can I import the same package/class twice? Will the JVM load the package twice at runtime?
Ans: One can import the same package or the same class multiple times. Neither compiler nor JVM complains about it. But the JVM will internally load the class only once no matter how many times you import the same class.

What is a static import?
Ans: By static import, we can access the static members of a class directly, there is no to qualify it with the class name.

What is Exception Handling?
Ans: Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors. It is mainly used to handle checked exceptions.

What is the difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?
Ans:

Checked Exception	Unchecked Exception
The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g.IOException, SQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.	The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions, e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.
What is the base class for Error and Exception?
Ans: Throwable.

Is it necessary that a catch block must follow each try block?
Ans: It is not necessary that a catch block must follow each try block. It should be followed by either a catch block OR a finally block. And whatever exceptions are likely to be thrown should be declared in the throws clause of the method.

What is finally block?
Ans: finally block is a block that is always executed.

Can finally block be used without a catch?
Ans: Yes, by try block. finally must be followed by either try or catch.

Is there any case when finally will not be executed?
Ans: finally will not be executed if program exits(either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort).

What is the difference between throw and throws?



Can an exception be rethrown?
Ans: Yes.

Can subclass overriding method declare an exception if the parent class method doesn’t throw an exception?
Ans: Yes, but only unchecked exception not checked.

What is exception propagation?
Ans: Forwarding the exception object to the invoking method is known as exception propagation.

What is the meaning of immutable in terms of String?
Ans: The simple meaning of immutable is unmodifiable or unchangeable. Once the string object has been created, its value can’t be changed.

Why are string objects immutable in java?
Ans: Because Java uses the concept of a string literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer by one object “Sachin”.If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables. That is why string objects are immutable in java.

How many ways can we create the string object?
Ans: There are two ways to create the string object, by a string literal and by new keyword.

How many objects will be created in the following code?
Ans:
String s1=”Welcome”;
String s2=”Welcome”;
String s3=”Welcome”;
Only one object.

Why java uses the concept of a string literal?
Ans: To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in constant string pool).

How many objects will be created in the following code?
Ans: String s = new String(“Welcome”);
Two objects, one in constant string pool and other in non-pool(heap).

What is the basic difference between string and StringBuffer object?
Ans: String is an immutable object. StringBuffer is a mutable object.

What is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans: StringBuffer is synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not synchronized.

How can we create an immutable class in java?
Ans: We can create an immutable class as the String class by defining a final class and

What is the purpose of the toString() method in java?
Ans: The toString() method returns the string representation of an object. If you print any object, java compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the object. So overriding the toString() method, returns the desired output, it can be the state of an object etc. depends on your implementation.

What is a nested class?
Ans: A class which is declared inside another class is known as a nested class. There are 4 types of nested class member inner class, local inner class, anonymous inner class, and static nested class.

Is there any difference between nested classes and inner classes?
Ans: Yes, inner classes are non-static nested classes, i.e. inner classes, are the part of nested classes.

Can we access the non-final local variable, inside the local inner class?
Ans: No, the local variable must be constant if you want to access it in a local inner class.

What is a nested interface?
Ans: Any interface, i.e. declared inside the interface or class, is known as a nested interface. It is static by default.

Can a class have an interface?
Ans: Yes, it is known as the nested interface.

Can an Interface have a class?
Ans: Yes, they are static implicitly.

What is Garbage Collection?
Ans: Garbage collection is a process of reclaiming the unused runtime objects. It is performed for memory management.

What is GC()?
Ans: GC() is a daemon thread.GC() method is defined in System class that is used to send the request to JVM to perform garbage collection.

What is the purpose of the finalize() method?
Ans: finalize() method is invoked just before the object is garbage collected. It is used to perform cleanup processing.

Can unreferenced objects be referenced again?
Ans: Yes.

What kind of thread is the Garbage collector thread?
Ans: Daemon thread.

What is the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Ans:

Final: final is a keyword, final can be variable, method or class. You, can’t change the value of the final variable, can’t override the final method, can’t inherit the final class.
Finally: finally block is used in exception handling. Finally, the block is always executed.
finalize(): finalize() method is used in garbage collection.finalize() method is invoked just before the object is garbage collected. The finalize() method can be used to perform any cleanup processing.
What is the purpose of the Runtime class?
Ans: The purpose of the Runtime class is to provide access to the Java runtime system.

How will you invoke any external process in Java?
Ans: By Runtime.getRuntime().exec(?) method.

What is the difference between the Reader/Writer class hierarchy and the InputStream/OutputStream class hierarchy?
Ans: The Reader/Writer class hierarchy is character-oriented, and the InputStream/OutputStream class hierarchy is byte-oriented.

What an I/O filter?
Ans: An I/O filter is an object that reads from one stream and writes to another, usually altering the data in some way as it is passed from one stream to another.

What is serialization?
Ans: Serialization is a process of writing the state of an object into a byte stream. It is mainly used to travel object’s state on the network.

What is Deserialization?
Ans: Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the serialized state. It is the reverse operation of serialization.

What is a transient keyword?
Ans: If you define any data member as transient, it will not be serialized.

What is Externalizable?
Ans: the Externalizable interface is used to write the state of an object into a byte stream in a compressed format. It is not a marker interface.

What is the difference between Serializable and Externalizable interface?
Ans: Serializable is a marker interface, but Externalizable is not a marker interface. When you use the Serializable interface, your class is serialized automatically by default. But you can override writeObject() and readObject() two methods to control more complex object serialization process. When you use Externalizable interface, you have complete control over your class’s serialization process.

What is a reflection?
Ans: Reflection is the process of examining or modifying the runtime behaviour of a class at runtime. It is used in:
IDE (Integrated Development Environment), e.g. Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans. Debugger Test Tools etc.

Read: DevOps Interview Questions
Can you access the private method from outside the class?
Ans: Yes, by changing the runtime behaviour of a class if the class is not secured.

What are wrapper classes?
Ans: Wrapper classes are classes that allow primitive types to be accessed as objects.

What is a native method?
Ans: A native method is a method that is implemented in a language other than Java.

What is the purpose of the System class?
