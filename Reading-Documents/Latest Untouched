Oracle & CTS

1) what is testing? Different types of testing.
Ans- Testing- its an step by step procedure to verify the software/application's each functionality whether its working as per requirement or not.
Types- whitebox(developer), blackbox(TE), greybox(TE), integration, system, UAT.
2) why we do automation testing?
Ans- Reasons- 
	Manual testing of all work flows, all fields, all negative scenarios is time and cost consuming.
	It is difficult to test for multi lingual sites manually.
	Automation does not require human intervention. We can run automated test unattended(Overnight).
	Automation increases speed of test execution.
	Automation helps increase test coverage.
	Manual testing can become boring and hence error prone.

3) explain me about ur project and it's architecture.
Ans- explains urs.
4) what is testing strategy?
Ans- A Test Strategy document is a high level document and normally developed by project manager. This document defines ※Software Testing Approach§ to achieve testing objectives. The Test Strategy is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification document.

The Test Strategy document is a static document meaning that it is not updated too often. It sets the standards for testing processes and activities and other documents such as the Test Plan draws its contents from those standards set in the Test Strategy Document.
5) what is test plan document and explain the contents briefly.
Ans- The Test Plan document is derived from the Product Description, Software Requirement Specification SRS, or Use Case Documents.
The Test Plan document is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Test Manager and the focus of the document is to describe what to test, how to test, when to test and who will do what test.
6) what is regression testing, how did u perform in your project?
Ans- Re-executing the old TC's in the new release to make sure that changes has not affected the existing features is called as regression testing. Explain as per ur proj.
7) how was QC useful in testing process in your project to log & track defects?
Ans- It is not used in my project. Explain if it is used in urs.


What is the default location for your local repository?
~/m2./repository.




8) what are the different types of testing life cycle models, which type of testing model does your project follow?have you worked in agile methodology in any of your project?
Ans- Types- Waterfall, Spiral/Iterative/Cycle, Prototype Model, Agile.
My project is using Agile methodology.
9) SQL query to find out 4th maximum salary.
Ans- SELECT SALARY FROM TABLE
WHERE SALARY IN                    
(SELECT SALARY FROM TABLE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC               
FETCH FIRST 4 ROWS ONLY)          
ORDER BY SALARY ASC                
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY           
10) write the self join query in order to find the department of the manager of a manager whose department is ABC.
Ans- Employee
emp mngr dept
A       B    ABC
B       D    HR
D       E    Dir

select MOM.dept from Employee E
join Employee M
on E.mngr = M.emp
join Employee MOM
on M.mngr = MOM.emp;

11) different types of joins, simple SQL queries like select, update etc.
Ans- inner join, left join, right join, full join.
12) simple unix commands to list a file, find all files which contains the desired word say your name in them.
Ans- Unix I am not sure.
13) what is your role in your project, how do you overcome hurdles that you might face when your immediate senior/manager is not present to attend a meeting with client and you have an important thing like an application crash occurs during testing, how do u handle such circumstances?
Ans- explain urs.
14) explain java in layman terms if I don't understand any technical stuffs like private, class or object..
Ans- Java is a programming language which is plateform independent i.e. we can compile code in one machine and can run in another machine with different OS. We can develop different kind of applications using java.
15) explain automation architecture and how what kind of architecture was in your project an explain it.
Ans- explain ur framework.
16) why do we use interfaces? Why is interface concept present when something could be achieved using classes or abstract classes?
Ans- to achieve 100% abstraction and standardization. By using classes and abstract classes we can't achieve 100% abstraction bcoz loop holes are there.

17) tell the use of abstract classes over interfaces, and how are interfaces built in terms of methods declared and variables within it..?
Ans- If the functionality you are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface. Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing common functionality to unrelated classes.
Interfaces can have only incomplete methods and all methods will be non-static and public. Variables declared inside interfaces will always be final, static and should be initialized.

18) questions on collections like how do you do sorting using collections? 
Ans- Collections.sort(List arg).

19)Giving an example, he asked me to chose which collection would I chose for that particular scenario.. Like getwindowhandles returns set, but can I also make use of list or any other collection? Similar questions..
Ans- No we can't use List.

19) testNG and how you could initiate your automation script..
Ans-TestNG is a unit Testing tool/Framework; We can run TestNG class directly or through TestNG Suite(xml)  we can also integrate with other tool like ANT, Maven, Jenkins

20) how to connect to database using selenium, it's requirements for connection and commands for connection.
Ans-using JDBC.
Example
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student","root","");
	Driver a = DriverManager.getDriver("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
	ResultSet r = con.createStatement().executeQuery("select * from student");
	int cc=r.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
	
	while(r.next())
	{for (int i=1;i<cc;i++)
		{
		System.out.println(r.getString(i));
		}
	}
	r.close();
	con.close();


 Please refer class notes for details.

21) differences between overloading and overriding, what is polymorphism, what is abstraction and write a program which shows me something which I understand about these concepts.
Ans- overloading 每 developing the same method with different arg type.
Overriding- developing the methods with same method signature but different method body. Inheritace must for overriding.
Polymorphism- an object showing different behaviour at different stages of development is known as Polymorphism.
Abstraction- its like hiding the implementations of the methods.
ex- class A{
	void test1(){
		System.out.println(※test1 of A§);
	}	
} 
class B extends A{
	void test1(){
		System.out.println(※test1 of B§);
	}
}
class C extends B{
	void sample(A  a){
		System.out.println(※sample method§);
		a.test1();
	}
}
class D{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		C c1 = new C();
		c1.sample(new A());
		c1.sample(new B());
		c1.test1();
	}
}
output of this program - 
A
B
B




22) write a program to check if the given input is palindrome or not by taking input from user at runtime.
Ans- class Palindrome{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int a = n;
		int palindrome =0;
		int r = 0;
		while(n>0){
			r = n%10;
			n = n/10;
			palindrome = palindrome*10 + r;
		}
		if(palindrome==a){
			System.out.println(a+§ number is palindrome.§);
		}else{
			System.out.println(a+§ number is not palindrome.§);
		}
	}
}
23) what is advantages of using testng, why can't we run selenium code directly?
Ans- can have 3kinds of report, parallel execution, skip a particular tc, change the order of execution, lots of annotaions, can execute without main method etc.. 
It is not necessary to use testng.xml to run the selenium code. You can directly run your selenium code. In order to create a test suite and run seperate test cases, you need some framework which drive the automation. Here testng.xml can be called as "driver" which drives several test cases automated using selenium code.

24) have you worked on Jenkins? What is advantages of it? What if developer does not use Jenkins, but testing team has been asked to use it? Can you do so without developer creating the build in Jenkins, your automation code can start?
Ans- Jenkins is a continues integration  tool; we use it to start the framework execution automatically as soon as the build is received from dev team ; If Dev team is not using Jenkins still testing team can use it where we can schedule the framework execution time or we can write customized script which can trigger the Frame Work 

25)disadvantages and advantages of selenium, where can all I not use selenium?
Ans- 
Disadvantages- can't automate windows based application, Cant Handle Tab Browseres ,Cant Handle Existing Browser; Cant Hanled Flex/Flash application etc.
Advantages- Free,Open Source, Platform independed;Supports All Browsers

26) given just 2days and you have like 100 testcases to manually execute and your colleague is on long leave, what will you do? U think this situation can occur real time? Can u execute all testcases alone within deadlines?
Ans- depends on the complexity of the application, if the each tc won't take much time then we can execute 100 tc. If it's taking much time in that case we will execute the test case's on the priority and severity basis. Like new test cases should be executed and if time remain then we will try to execute as many as we can from the existing tcs.

27) what is the code to find the active element in the web page?
Ans- List<WebElement> allElements = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//*"));
		for(int i=0;i<allElements.size();i++)
		{
			WebElement e=allElements.get(i);
			
			if(e.isEnabled())
			{	
			System.out.println(e.getTagName());
			}
		}

28) write a selenium program to verify that the navigation of the web page is landing at the correct URL at the next page..
Ans- driver.fiindElement(By.xpath(※xpath of anylink which u wan to check§)).click();
         String expURL = ※give expected url§;
         String act = driver.getCurrentUrl();
         Assert.assertEquals(act,exp);

29) write a code to make use of assert if my username is incorrect.
Ans- try{
		Assert.assertEquals(actUserName),expUserName) 
	}catch(Exception e){
		Syste.out.println(※name is invalid§);
	}
30) what is the skeleton of testng.xml? What all does/can it contain?
Ans- 
suite 
 |- test
    |-classes
        |- class

refer http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml


31) code for switching frames back and forth( getting into frames and out to main frame)
Ans- 
driver.switchTo().frame(arg);
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

32) write a program to extract information from xl sheet and print it to the reporting sheet(reporter.log) and console.
Ans- FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(※path of file§);
	Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(fis);
	String info = wb.getSheet(※SheetName§).getRow(rownum).getCell(cellNum).getStringCellValue();
	Reporter.log(info, true);

33) how confident are you in manual testing,selenium,java?
Ans- out of 10- manual 每 7, selenium-9, and java 每 9.

34) code to write the usage of actions class with an example, usage of select class
Ans- ex- Actions act = new Actions(driver); 
	  act.moveToElement(webElement).perform();

Select sel = new Select(WebElement);
sel.selectByValue("v");

35) switching between the two browsers(parent and child), popup differences and identification.
Ans- Iterator<String> it = driver.getWindowHandles().iterator();
	String parent = it.next();
	String child = it.next();
	driver.switchTo().window(child);
	driver.switchTo().window(parent);

There are 6 Diff types of Popups-Alert;Hidden Div;Page on Load;File Upload;File Download;Window popup

2.Which Repository we are using in selenium for .xls sheet(To store and retrieve data from .xls sheet )?
Ans- we can store it inside project i.e. open the java project and copy the .xls file there and use it.
3.Different way to find out the web elements?
Ans- xpath(), tagName(), className(), linkText(), partialLinkText(), cssSelector(), id(), name().
4.What is the command to open the Firefox Browser and URL?
Ans- WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get(※url§); or driver.navigate().to(※url§);
5.What is Hybrid Framework?
Ans- Its is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.
6.What is the difference between Hybrid Framework and Function driven Framework?
Ans- In Function driven fw,we use the same functions/methods again and again by calling them in different modules. Hybrid driven framework is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.
7.When we use CSS Selector?
And- it is used to find any web element in the web page. Some time it is better to use css selector in place of xpath because of performance point of view.
