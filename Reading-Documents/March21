20 : What is an array in java?
Answer : An array is container object in java which can hold fixed number of values of same type.

To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −

Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.

Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.


example -

 //Include all db values for each text box in an array


            Object[] valueArray = new Object[8] { dbname, dbvendorid, dbcounty, dbstate,
                                                  dbemail, dbphone, dbstatus, dblegacynumber };

            //Enter value, search, and validate for each text box
            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
            {
                Driver.SendKey(elementArray[i], valueArray[i].ToString(), "Search for a value in search panel");
                ClickOnSearch();
                ValidSearchPanelCheck();

--Question: How will you differentiate HashMap from HashTable?
Answer: HashMap in Java is a Map-based collection class, used for storing key & value pairs. It is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V> HashTable is an array of a list, where each list is called a bucket. Values contained in a HashTable are unique and depend on the key. Methods are not synchronized in HashMap, while key methods are synchronized in HashTable

HashMap - It is an unordered and unsorted map and hence, is a good choice when there is no emphasis on the order. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values and doesn't maintain any insertion order.
HashTable – Doesn't allow anything null and has methods that are synchronized. As it allows for thread safety, the performance is slow.


===============================================================================================================================================
--HashSet and Linked Hashset 
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet.
===============================================================================================================================================
Q;What is a static class?
A class can be said to be static class if all the variables and methods of the class are static and the constructor is private. Making the constructor private will prevent the class to be instantiated. So the only possibility to access is using the Class name only.

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

Q: What is object-oriented programming? Is Java an object-oriented language?
Essentially, object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that works on the concept of objects. Simply put, objects are containers – they contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. Following that logic, an object-oriented language is a language that works on objects and procedure.

Q:Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool.

Q:Use of OOPs in framework ?polmor /encapsulatin/inheritance/abstraction
Ans -
ABSTRACTION
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. We utilize these locators in tests but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.

Interface 
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); we are initializing Firefox browser using Selenium WebDriver. It means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface (WebDriver) and creating an Object. Here WebDriver is an Interface as mentioned earlier and FirefoxDriver is a class.

INHERITANCE
We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc., in the Base Class.

METHOD OVERLOADING
We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading

ENCAPSULATION
All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.


WEB ELEMENT:
Web element is an interface used to identify the elements in a web page.

WEBDRIVER:
WebDriver is an interface used to launch different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.,

FIND BY:
FindBy is an annotation used in Page Object Model design pattern to identify the elements.

FIND ELEMENT:
Find Element is a method in POM to identify the elements in a web page.

==============================================================================
What are the types of WebDriver APIs available in Selenium?
Firefox Driver
Gecko Driver
InternetExplorer Driver
Chrome Driver
HTMLUnit Driver
Opera Driver
Safari Driver
Android Driver
iPhone Driver
EventFiringWebDriver

==============================================================================
Is the FirefoxDriver a Class or an Interface? 
FirefoxDriver is a Java class, and it implements the WebDriver interface.
==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both implicit wait and explicit wait in a Selenium Script?
As per the official Selenium documentation, it is suggested not to mix both Implicit waits and Explicit Waits. Mixing both of them can cause unpredictable wait times.

Implicit wait is defined only once in the code. It will remain same throughout the driver object instance.

Explicit wait is defined whenever it is necessary in the code. This wait will call at the time of execution. It is a conditional wait.

Explicit wait will overwrite the implicit wait where ever explicit wait is applied. So, Explicit Wait gets first preference then Implicit Wait.

==============================================================================
What happen if you mix both Thread.Sleep and WebDriver Waits in a Selenium Script?
Thread.sleep() method can be used to pause the execution for specified time in milliseconds

If we use WebDriver waits along with Thread.sleep() method then webdriver will hold the execution for specified time and then will follow other wait. Test execution time will become more, if we mix both waits.
==============================================================================
How can we handle windows based pop up?
Selenium doesn’t support windows based applications. It is an automation testing tool which supports only web application testing. We could handle windows based popups in Selenium using some third party tools such as AutoIT, Robot class etc.

==Q: How will you handle dynamic elements in selenium ?

Ans - Use regular expression like starts-with , ends-with , contains 

Dynamic elements are web elements which have identifiers that are dynamically generated during run time. Dynamic identifiers could be for any web element of the page but normally used for buttons, text fields and buttons.

Let us take an example of a button whose ID is in the following format…

// Dynamic Element Locators
<button id="Submit-901" />
<button id="Submit-902" />
<button id="Submit-903" />

 @After("@Second")
    public void afterSecond(){
        System.out.println("This will run only after the Second Scenario");

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name

--Question: Could you draw a comparison between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array necessitates for giving the size during the time of declaration, while an array list doesn't necessarily require size as it changes size dynamically. To put an object into an array, there is the need to specify the index. However, no such requirement is in place for an array list. While an array list is parameterized, an array is not parameterized.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

Q:Stale Element Reference Exception: 
A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second. 
The two reasons for Stale element reference are 
1. The element has been deleted entirely. 2. The element is no longer attached to the DOM. 
We face this stale element reference exception when the element we are interacting is destroyed and then recreated again. When this happens the reference of the element in the DOM becomes stale. Hence we are not able to get the reference to the element.

Can we declare the main method of our class as private?

Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.

===========================================================================================================================================
Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?

Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?

Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q50. What's the default access specifier for variables and methods of a class?

Ans: Default access specifier for variables and method is package protected i.e variables and class is available to any other class but in the same package,not outside the package.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q52. How can we restrict inheritance for a class so that no class can be inherited from it?

Ans: If we want a class not to be extended further by any class, we can use the keyword Final with the class name.

In the following example, Stone class is Final and can't be extend

public Final Class Stone {
	// Class methods and Variables
}

Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Ans: Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. We can apply different methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q57. Which types of exceptions are caught at compile time?

Ans: Checked exceptions can be caught at the time of program compilation. Checked exceptions must be handled by using try catch block in the code in order to successfully compile the code.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q61. A person says that he compiled a java class successfully without even having a main method in it? Is it possible?

Ans: main method is an entry point of Java class and is required for execution of the program however; a class gets compiled successfully even if it doesn't have a main method. It can't be run though.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q63. What are the two environment variables that must be set in order to run any Java programs?

Ans: Java programs can be executed in a machine only once following two environment variables have been properly set:

PATH variable
CLASSPATH variable

Path --
Once you installed Java on your machine, it is required to Set the PATH environment variable to conveniently run the executable (javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command, such as:

ClassPath -
it is speciifc to java 
===========================================================================================================================================
Q64. Can variables be used in Java without initialization?
Ans: In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn't compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q65. Can a class in Java be inherited from more than one class?
Ans: In Java, a class can be derived from only one class and not from multiple classes. Multiple inheritances is not supported by Java.
===========================================================================================================================================
Q66. Can a constructor have different name than a Class name in Java?

Ans: Constructor in Java must have same name as the class name and if the name is different, it doesn't act as a constructor and compiler thinks of it as a normal method.

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

What’s the difference between plug-ins and dependencies
Both plugins and dependencies are Jar files.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?

5) What is bug leakage and bug release?
Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release. During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while testing the software.
===============================================================================================================
10. Can we do system testing at any stage?
No. System testing should start only if all modules are in place and they work correctly. However, it should be performed before UAT (user acceptance testing).

===========================================================================================================================================
22. What is mutation testing?
Mutation testing is a technique to identify if a set of test data or test case is useful by intentionally introducing various code changes (bugs) and retesting with original test data/ cases to determine if the bugs are detected.

Q:Can we have static class in Java ?
In java, we can’t make Top-level (outer) class static. Only nested classes can be static.

=============================================================================
Why Variable in the Interface is public static final ?

public: for the accessibility across all the classes, just like the methods present in the interface

static: as interface cannot have an object, the interfaceName.variableName can be used to reference it or directly the variableName in the class implementing it.

final: to make them constants. If 2 classes implement the same interface and you give both of them the right to change the value, conflict will occur in the current value of the var, which is why only one time initialization is permitted.

What is an anonymous inner class? How is it different from an inner class?
Any local inner class which has no name is known as an anonymous inner class. Since it doesn’t have any name, it is impossible to create its constructor. It always either extends a class or implements an interface, and is defined and instantiated in a single statement.

A non-static nested class is called an inner class. Inner classes are associated with the objects of the class and they can access all methods and variables of the outer class.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

Import university.department.*

What do you know about an exception test in Selenium?
An exception test is a special exception that occurs in a test class.
Suppose, we have created a test case that can throw an exception.

In this case, the @Test annotation can help us specify the exception that could occur.

Check out from the below example.

@Test(actualException = ElementNotVisibleException.class)
=============================================================================

What is the difference between @Factory and @Data Provider annotation?
Answer: @DataProvider is concerned with individual test methods and run the specific methods for many times. @Factory method creates test class instances and runs all the test methods in that class with different data. sets.

Factory and @DataProvider annotation
TestNG Factory is useful when you want to run multiple test classes through a single test class.
Example 

public class Test1 {

	@Test
	public void test1() {
		System.out.println("Test1 test method");
	}
}


public class Test2 {

	@Test
	public void test2() {
		System.out.println("Test2 test method");
	}
}


Public class TestNGFactory {

	@Factory()
	public Object[] getTestClasses() {
		Object[] tests = new Object[2];
		tests[0] = new Test1();
		tests[1] = new Test2();
		return tests;

Test coverage is a quality metric to represent the amount (in percentage) of testing completed for a product. It is relevant for both functional and non-functional testing activities. This metric is used to add missing test cases.
==============================================================================
Q7. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?

The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one .
Singletons often control access to resources, such as database connections or sockets.

Example :  you have a license for only one connection for your database or your JDBC driver has trouble with multithreading, the Singleton makes sure that only one connection is made or that only one thread can access the connection at a time.

Creating Singleton class ==>
To design a singleton class:
1.Make constructor as private.
2.Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.

Normal class vs Singleton class: Difference in normal and singleton class in terms of instantiation is that, For normal class we use constructor, whereas for singleton class we use getInstance() method 

==============================================================================
Explain System.out.println();
--System : is a final class in  java.lang package.As this is final class so this cannot be inherited 
--out : is a static member of system class. It is an instance of java.io.PrintStream. This stream is already open and ready to accept output data.
--println : is a method of java.io.PrintStream .It is an overloaded method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between “this” and “super” keywords in Java?
--this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

--This 
public class Test{

int a =10;

public void TI(){
int a= 20;
this.a=a;

system.println("Print the Value of a = " + a);

}

}
output of the progm 
Print the Value of a = 20;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Super 
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Public class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  

Public class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
Public void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  i.e black 
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  i.e white
}  
}  


Public class TestSuper1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog dog=new Dog();

Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.
=============================================================================
Q: Advantage of Overriding 

Advantage of method overriding
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes, so if a child class needs to use the parent class method, it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.

class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}

==============================================================================
Q: why class cannot be private ?
Private classes are allowed, but only as inner or nested classes. If you have a private inner or nested class, then access is restricted to the scope of that outer class.

If you have a private class on its own as a top-level class, then you can't get access to it from anywhere. So it does not make sense to have a top level private class.
==============================================================================
Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.
invoke():It invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters.

What do you mean by defect detection percentage in software testing?
Defect detection percentage (DDP) is a type of testing metric. It indicates the effectiveness of a testing process by measuring the ratio of defects discovered before the release and reported after the release by customers.

For example, let’s say, the QA has detected 70 defects during the testing cycle and the customer reported 20 more after the release. Then, DDP would be: 70/(70 + 20) = 72.1%

What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?

Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

1) For Loops

For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.

2) While Loops

While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.

3) Do While Loops

Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.

Answer : Same as method overloading, Single class can have multiple constructors with same name as class name but all have different signatures (different input parameters and types) is called constructor overloading. 
==============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

Q5. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
Statis always deals with class not objects thats why .
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; 
this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there.

static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only static methods of the class.
=============================================================================
11. What are the different types of Annotations used in Selenium? Explain the JUnit Annotation linked with Selenium.
In Java, a special form of syntactic metadata can be added to Java source code, which is known as ‘annotations’. Variables, parameters, packages, methods, and classes are annotated. Some of the JUnit annotations are:

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith

@Test: The @Test annotation finds a method to be a test method. When used before a test method, it is mentioned as ‘@Test’; it informs the JUnit framework that the following method is a test method.
@Before: The @Before annotation is used to find the method that is executed before executing the test method. This method can be used to set up the test environment.
@After: The @After annotation is a method that is executed after executing the test method. This method can be used to do a teardown, i.e., it is a method used to delete all temporary data, set-up default values, clean up the test environment, etc.
@BeforeClass: The @BeforeClass method is used only once before the start of all tests. Basically, this is used to perform cumbersome activities, like connecting to a database.
@AfterClass: The @AfterClass method is used only once after executing all tests. Basically, this is used to carry out clean-up activities, like disconnecting from a database.
============================================================================
Question: What is Set in Java? Also, explain its types in a Java Collections.
LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet. The only difference between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is that: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order. When we iterate through a HashSet, the order is unpredictable while it is predictable in case of LinkedHashSet

Tree Set : TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. ... TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed. Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
->Duplicate values not allowed 
->Values are sorted in Ascending Order

Q: What is  differences between API and Web Service?

All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.

===================================================================================================================================
Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.
============================================================================
Q:: Can we test APIs or web services using Selenium webdriver?
No selenium webdriver uses browser's native method to automate the web applications. Since web services are headless, so we cannot automate web services using selenium webdriver.

==============================================================================
What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

But the difference between them is, most of the work in maven is done using plugins; whereas dependency is just a Jar file which will be added to the classpath while executing the tasks.

For example, you use a compiler-plugin to compile the java files. You can't use compiler-plugin as a dependency since that will only add the plugin to the classpath

Q:Can we instantiate an abstract class? ----No , but they can be suclassed.

Q:Can an abstract class inherit another abstract class -----No , If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated. To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

Q:Can we instantiate an interface ----No ,You can never instantiate a interface in java however, you can refer to an object that implements an interface by the type of the interface.

Q:Use of monochrome option in cucumber - This option can either set as true or false (default value is false). If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable.

Q:What is regular expressions? How you can use regular expressions in Selenium ?
A regular expression is a special text string used for describing a search pattern. In Selenium IDE regular expression can be used with the keyword- regexp: as a prefix to the value and patterns needs to be included for the expected values.

16 : Can we overload static methods? 
Ans:yes , both static as well as non static 

public class Test { 
    public static void foo() { 
        System.out.println("Test.foo() called "); 
    } 
    public static void foo(int a) {

18 : What is an interface in java?
An interface is a blue print of a class which can hold abstract methods (Methods without implementation) only. It creates Rules To Follow structure for class where It Is Implemented. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java. 
eske methods ki implementation kisi aur class mein hogi .

// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}


----Another example

Public  interface X
{
   public void myMethod();//abstract method 
}

Public interface Y
{
   public void myMethod();
}

Public  class JavaExample implements X, Y
{
   public void myMethod()
   {
       System.out.println("Implementing more than one interfaces");

42. What is fluent wait in selenium?
A fluent wait is a type of wait in which we can also specify polling interval(intervals after which driver will try to find the element) along with the maximum timeout value.

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception". The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Example of explicit wait 
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Syntax :
Implicit wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);	
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;	

explicit wait :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/a/i")));

Q:Can Constructor can be private 

Ans Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.
===============================================================================
Question: Can a class be private?
Answer: Only nested or inner classes can be private because they can be accessed by the outer class. A normal class cannot be final because you can not instantiate it (create object).
===============================================================================
Question: How is a constant variable different from a global variable?
Answer: Global variables can be modified and are accessible by all the functions in a program. Constant variables have a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the program.

Q:Which is the only browser that supports Selenium IDE to be used?
Firefox
===============================================================================
public class TestNG {
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 
 @Test (priority = 0)
 public void CloseBrowser() {
 driver.close();
 System.out.println("Closing Google Chrome browser");
 }
 
 @Test (priority = -1)
 public void OpenBrowser() {
 System.out.println("Launching Google Chrome browser");         
 driver.get("https://www.demoqa.com");
 }
 
 @Test
 public void AccountTest(){
 System.out.println("Some tests for Customer Account");
 }
}


Answer - first -1 priority wale method will run ---> then Account test wala and at last 0 prioty wala
Observe that the AccountTest method ran before CloseBrowser even without having any priority because both sets to priority = 0, and hence, they run alphabetically.

===============================================================================
Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}  
}

What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

----------Listners in TestNG---------------
What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;



===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
===============================================================================

--Innerjoin vs outer join

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
----------
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Example - 2 tables hain orders and customers donno mein customer id common row hain 
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
------------------
Left join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------
Right Join 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name

Q:How to call private method from another class
Ans:We can call the private method of a class from another class in Java - by changing the runtime behavior of the class by using some predefined methods of Java

To call the private method, we will use following methods of Java.lang.class and Java.lang.reflect.Method

Method[] getDeclaredMethods(): This method returns a Method object that reflects the specified declared method of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
setAccessible(): Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks.

===============================================================================
Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == ?
In general both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the differences between the two:

Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator.
We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // True because content is same.
== == == == 
Example 
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("HELLO"); 
        String s2 = new String("HELLO"); 
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
    } 
} 

Answer : False , true 
Both s1 and s2 refers to different objects.
When we use == operator for s1 and s2 comparison then the result is false as both have different addresses in memory.
Using equals, the result is true because its only comparing the values given in s1 and s2.

===============================================================================
Q:Can we have instance variabel in abstarct class and Interface 
Ans - Yes

Abstract class will have constructor but no object 
Interface will not have any constructor nor the object

What is Enum in Java?
Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example, in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.

Enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.

                "Message from nested static class: "
                + msg);
        }
    }
  
  
Advantage of static class - Nested class to be mase as static class , it can use any variable of outer class even without intializing .example dekho upar wala

Q:Can Constructor can be private 

Ans Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.
===============================================================================
Question: How is a constant variable different from a global variable?
Answer: Global variables can be modified and are accessible by all the functions in a program. Constant variables have a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the program.

===============================================================================
public class TestNG {
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 
 @Test (priority = 0)
 public void CloseBrowser() {
 driver.close();
 System.out.println("Closing Google Chrome browser");
 }
 
 @Test (priority = -1)
 public void OpenBrowser() {
 System.out.println("Launching Google Chrome browser");         
 driver.get("https://www.demoqa.com");
 }
 
 @Test
 public void AccountTest(){
 System.out.println("Some tests for Customer Account");
 }
}


Answer - first -1 priority wale method will run ---> then Account test wala and at last 0 prioty wala
Observe that the AccountTest method ran before CloseBrowser even without having any priority because both sets to priority = 0, and hence, they run alphabetically.
===============================================================================
Q:Define grouping in TestNG?
The group is an attribute in TestNG that allows you to execute the multiple test cases. For example, if we have 100 test cases of it_department and 10 test cases of hr_department, and if you want to run all the test cases of it_department together in a single suite, this can be possible only through the grouping.

public class Test_methods   
{  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void java()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a java developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void dot_net()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a .Net developer");  
}  
@Test(groups="it_department")  
public void tester()  
{  
System.out.println("I am a software tester");  
}  
@Test (groups="hr")  
public void hr()  
{  
System.out.print("I am hr");  
}  
}

Q: What is depends on group ?

dependsOnGroups
It is similar to the dependsOnMethods attribute. It allows the test methods to depend on the group of test methods. It executes the group of test methods before the dependent test method.


package com.javatpoint;  
import org.testng.annotations.Test;  
public class Test_cases  
{  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase1()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase1");  
 }  
 @Test(groups="test")  
 public void testcase2()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase2");  
 }  
 @Test(dependsOnGroups="test")  
 public void testcase3()  
 {  
     System.out.println("testcase3");  
 }  
}  

===============================================================================
What is timeOut in TestNG?

While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut.

TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels:

At the suit level: It will be available to all the test methods.
At each method level: It will be available to a particular test method.
The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below:

@Test( timeOut = 700)  
The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case.

Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
 In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number. 

===============================================================================
Q21. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?
In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

===============================================================================
Q39. What's the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn't flow in the proceeding cases too. 

===============================================================================
Q41. How we can execute any code even before main method?
If we want to execute any statements before even creation of objects at load time of class, we can use a static block of code in the class. Any statements inside this static block of code will get executed once at the time of loading the class even before creation of objects in the main method.

===============================================================================
Q45. Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?
Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It's called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can't invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation. 

===============================================================================
Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?
Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked. 

===============================================================================
Q:What are the different types of Exploratory testing techniques?

Exploratory Testing as the name suggests is based on the tester exploring the website or app to be able to make it better with time. It is a substantial activity in an Agile software development, where the development and the testing cycles go hand in hand.

1. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing :

Scenario-based Exploratory testing is when the user Explores and tests a particular scenario or functionality. Based on the learning and observation of the website or app, and its functionalities, the tester could explore and find defects for different scenarios using an Exploratory Testing technique. They tend to check a different set of possibilities with scenario-based exploratory testing.

2. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing :

The approach of this type of exploratory testing is based on strategies such as boundary value analysis, risk evaluation, equivalence technique. To perform strategy based exploratory testing, the tester must be familiar with the website or application functionalities to be able to conduct it with efficiency for better results.

3. Freestyle Exploratory Testing :

Freestyle Exploratory Testing is used mainly when the tester wants to do a quick smoke testing. As the name suggests, it does not have any defined approach, scenario or coverage of testing, instead, the tester proceeds in freestyle to investigate about defects.

Q:Difference git pull and git fetch ?

git fetch pulls latest changes done by other devs from remote reporsiroty to local repo and then you have to run merge command to merge the changes in your local

git pull -Download and merges the changes in your local.
===============================================================================
Q:Can we have a return statement in the finally clause? What will happen? (detailed answer)
Yes, you can use the return statement in finally block, but it will not prevent finally block from being executed. BTW, if you also used the return statement in the try block then return the value from the finally block with override whatever is returned from the try block.

		Actions action = new Actions(driver);
	
	
		action.moveToElement(hoverToSee);
		action.clickAndHold(hoverToSee).build().perform();
		
		
		WebElement tt = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(@class,'tooltip')]"));
	String ttt = tt.getText();
	System.out.print("Text Extracted = " + ttt);
	Boolean abc = tt.isDisplayed();
	}

===============================================================================
Q:Difference in drop and trucate 

DROP is a DDL Command. Objects deleted using DROP are permanently lost and it cannot be rolled back.
Unlike TRUNCATE which only deletes the data of the tables, the DROP command deletes the data of the table as well as removes the entire schema/structure of the table from the database.

Example DROP TABLE Employees;

===============================================================================
The DELETE statement in SQL is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) Command. It is used to delete existing records from an existing table

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];

===============================================================================
What is JVM and is it platform independent?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the heart of java programming language. JVM is responsible for converting byte code into machine readable code. JVM is not platform independent, thats why you have different JVM for different operating systems.

JDK provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. The execution part is handled by JVM to provide machine independence.

===============================================================================
Can we declare a class as static?
We can’t declare a top-level class as static however an inner class can be declared as static. If inner class is declared as static, it’s called static nested class.
===============================================================================
Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
The task of java compiler is to convert java program into bytecode, we have javac executable for that. So it must be stored in JDK, we don’t need it in JRE and JVM is just the specs.

10) What is OutOfMemoryError in java?

OutOfMemoryError is the sub class of java.lang.Error which occurs when JVM runs out of memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Can we keep the statements after finally block If the control is returning from the finally block itself?

No, it gives unreachable code error. Because, control is returning from the finally block itself. Compiler will not see the statements after it. That’s why it shows unreachable code error.

--Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System.exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software crash and etc. Other than these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Can we write only try block without catch and finally blocks?

No, It shows compilation error. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally block. You can remove either catch block or finally block but not both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================
1) Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java? (detailed answer)
String is immutable while both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable, which means any change e.g. converting String to upper case or trimming white space will produce another instance rather than changing the same instance. In later two, StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, in fact, it's a ditto replacement of StringBuffer added in Java 1.5.
================================================Latest Questions added on 6th Aprl===============================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

Q:Differnce between git commit , git push and git sync 

--Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
--Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
--Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.

202- It indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
206 Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource 
301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
403 - 403 Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
407 Proxy Authentication Required - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy

Q:What is Agile? --
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

Q:What is Sprint?
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.
Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
===============================================================================
Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)
In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.
===============================================================================
Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)

Q:How to rerun the failed scenarios using Cucumber?

include one line in the test runner file ====> "rerun:target/rerun.txt"

Cucumber writes the failed scenarios line numbers in rerun.txt

Example : 

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "classpath:features",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports",
              "json:target/cucumber.json",
              "rerun:target/rerun.txt"} //Creates a text file with failed scenarios
              ,tags = "@mytag"
           )
public class MyScenarioTests   {

}

Step 2 :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    monochrome = true,
    features = "@target/rerun.txt", 							//Cucumber picks the failed scenarios from this file 
    format = {"pretty", "html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",

===============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?
Ans - Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses
===============================================================================
20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

Ans -Constructor cannot be static because it cannot be call as method or variable, so no need to placing a static variable before constructor. abstract means incomplete, for complementing it we need an implementation class/interface. Constructor doesn't required to be abstract because it doesn't need to be implemented.
===============================================================================
Q:33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

This way variables cannot be called in another class .
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return
type of method in java?

Overloading is the mechanism of binding the method call with the method body dynamically based on the parameters passed to the method call. ... It is not possible to decide to execute which method based on the return type, therefore, overloading is not possible just by changing the return type of the method.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.

3.how to rerun failed test cases apart from failed test report
Method 1 - Run a testNg.XML file ---> check testOutput folder ---> look for testng-failed.xml>> Run as TestNg. This will now only re-run the fail testcase(s).


Method 2 -By implementing TestNG IRetryAnalyzer
There are many reasons for testcases to fail. Some of them could be:
-Element not visible,
-Stale element,
-Time out exception etc.

If testcases have failed for above reasons, then we can easily re-run such testcases in TestNg by implementing the IRetryAnalyzer class. The steps are explained further below.

import org.testng.IRetryAnalyzer;

import org.testng.ITestResult;

public class RetryFailedTestCases implements IRetryAnalyzer {

    private int retryCnt = 0;

    //You can mention maxRetryCnt (Maximium Retry Count) as per your requirement. This example uses 2 which means that for any failed testcases it retires the run twice.

    private int maxRetryCnt = 2;

    //This method will be called everytime a test fails. It will return TRUE if a test fails and need to be retried, else it returns FALSE

    public boolean retry(ITestResult result) {

        if (retryCnt < maxRetryCnt) {

            System.out.println(“Retrying ” + result.getName() + ” again and the count is ” + (retryCnt+1));

            retryCnt++;

            return true;

        }

What is the difference between error and an exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error.

These JVM errors and you can not repair them at runtime. While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input etc. Example: FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference.

In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving user a feedback for entering proper values etc.).

Q> What is singleton design pattern? (GE, Avaya, Mindtree, HCL)
Ans :-
 in Java then you must have used new keyword. This new keyword create an Object of class whenever required. But there are some scenarios where you don’t want to create individual Object for different purpose. Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever object of given class is required, only single(No more than one object) Object get returned

we will create a private Constructor and also a static method to create object of the same class.
class JBT {
 
	
private static JBT instance = null;
 
	/*
	 * As private constructor is used so can not create object of this class
	 * directly. Except by using static method of same class.
	 */
	private JBT() {
 
	}

6) There are three statements in a try block – statement1, statement2 and statement3. After that there is a catch block to catch the exceptions occurred in the try block. Assume that exception has occurred in statement2. Does statement3 get executed or not?

No. Once a try block throws an exception, remaining statements will not be executed. control comes directly to catch block.

What is the difference between error and exception in java?

Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
===============================================================================
7. What will happen if I insert duplicate value in a Hashset and Hashmap ?
Remember, HashMap can not have duplicate keys. Behind the scene HashSet uses a HashMap.

When you attempt to add any object into a HashSet, this entry is actually stored as a key in the HashMap - the same HashMap that is used behind the scene of HashSet. Since this underlying HashMap needs a key-value pair, a dummy value is generated for us.

Now when you try to insert another duplicate object into the same HashSet, it will again attempt to be insert it as a key in the HashMap lying underneath. However, HashMap does not support duplicates. Hence, HashSet will still result in having only one value of that type

2. How do we achieve parallel execution in TestNG?
Parallel testing or parallel execution, as the name suggests, is a process of running the test case parallelly rather than one after the other. In parallel testing, the program’s multiple parts (or modules) execute together, saving the testers a lot of time and effort. The operating system’s functionalities do this, but as a user, we need to trigger parallel execution through TestNG. As an example, you can think of having software with two different versions and running them in parallel with the help of TestNG. Parallel execution would give us the correct idea of the stability and performance of the software much faster than running serially.

A double colon :: is used to separate the axis specifier from the node test.
===============================================================================
4. What's the difference between imports and extends?

To extend a public class you need to import it first.
In case of import, we can import all the classes and interface to our current class by importing package name.
But in case of extends we can only imported methods and data members of a particular single class.
===============================================================================
5. Why do we use extends when we have imports options ?
extending a class means we can override the methods defined in the class to be inherited. Package import is just a way to tell the classloader where to look for your classes and also differentiate between classes with the same name. Class extend tells JVM the heirarchical relationship between your classes.
===============================================================================
What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? 
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection. But, by using ListIterator you can add elements to a collection.
Using Iterator, you can not remove an element in a collection where, as You can remove an element from a collection using ListIterator.
Using Iterator you can traverse all collections like Map, List, Set. But, by ListIteror you can traverse List implemented objects only.
===============================================================================
What is difference between Array and ArrayList ? When will you use Array over ArrayList ?
Since an array is static in nature i.e. you cannot change the size of an array once created, So, if you need an array which can resize itself then you should use the ArrayList.

In properties file we keep xpaths, URL, default user name and password etc.
===============================================================================
Q: WHat is thread in testNG.XML file in case of parallel testing ?

Threads in parallel testing refer to different parts in which the test execution will be divided and run parallelly

So if there are two threads and two methods, they will take one method each and run them parallelly (if we are running the methods parallelly). But if there are three methods and two threads, one will have to wait until one thread is free and takes up that method for execution. Therefore, we need to specify the number of threads we want to run while performing parallel testing in TestNG.


<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name = "Parallel Testing Suite">
   <test name = "Parallel Tests" parallel = "methods" thread-count = "2">--------------------------------Es ki baat ho rhi hai 
      <classes>
         <class name = "ParallelTest" />
      </classes>
   </test>
</suite>


Note - example let us suppose there are 3 methods and you defined thread as 2 .then 2 parallel chalenge , aur jab ek thread free hogi tab woh 3rd method ke liye chalega .In this case 2 methods ka same thread id hoga aur 3rd ka alag ...
===============================================================================
As I mentioned, if we run the test methods directly through the test case file (Run As -> TestNG Test) rather than the XML file, they will run serially. Run the file in the same way (serially) and notice the time taken for overall execution.

17. Give the example for String immutable code?

class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  

Output:Sachin

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with sachintendulkar. That is why string is known as immutable.

===============================================================================
Q2.where all of abstract methods of webdriver are implemented?

SearchContext is the super most interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called WebDriver.

What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?
TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc.

Following are the scenarios that can be made:

If the test case is failed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is passed, then what action should be performed by the listener.
If the test case is skipped, then what action should be performed by the listener.

8) If try With Multiple catch Block Present, Is Order of catch Blocks Important in 
Which Order We Have To Take?

Yes , jaise aapke codd mein pehle arthmetic error aani hai to pehle uske respective catch block hona chaiye ..
agli exception say IO error h , then uske respective block hona chaiye 
===============================================================================
10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--
===============================================================================
11)Is it Possible To Take try, catch Inside try Block?
No , In Java, we can use a try block within a try block. Each time a try statement is entered, the context of that exception is pushed on to a stack

===============================================================================
16)In Which Situation Finally Block Will Not Executed?
Ans - if try block will have a statement System.exit();
===============================================================================
17)If Return Statement Present Inside try, is Finally Block Will Be Executed?
Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed.
===============================================================================
19)Is it Possible To Write Any Statement Between try-catch And finally?
No, we cannot write any statements in between try, catch and finally blocks and these blocks form one unit
===============================================================================
20)Is it Possible To Take 2 finally Blocks For The Same try?
You can only have one finally clause per try/catch/finally statement
===============================================================================
29)Is it Possible To Use throws Keyword For Any Java Class?
No ,It is used in method definition, to declare that a risky method is being called.
===============================================================================
What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.

1.Install the Auto it in your machine 
2.After installation it will go to c:/program(x86)/autoit
3.There is a file - Au3Info_x64 - which is basically a finder 
4.Scite is a file which is a editior 

--Commands : controlfocus , controlsetTest,ControlClick(These two be used in AutoIt)

Note : InetGet is used in Auto it to Downloads a file from the internet using the HTTP, HTTPS or FTP protocol.

Run auto it script in selenium
Runtime.getRuntime().exe

===============================================================================
Q: What are Broken Links?
Broken links are links or URLs that are not reachable. They may be down or not functioning due to some server error

An URL will always have a status with 2xx which is valid. There are different HTTP status codes which are having different purposes. For an invalid request, HTTP status is 4xx and 5xx.

Why should you check Broken links?
You should always make sure that there are no broken links on the site because the user should not land into an error page.

The error happens if the rules are not updated correctly, or the requested resources are not existing at the server.

Manual checking of links is a tedious task, because each webpage may have a large number of links & manual process has to be repeated for all pages.

===============================================================================
Q: what is the tag present for links and images in DOM 

Links ---a--- it will have property href

Collections: HashMap-----key and value. If we have states and cities, which will be the key ?
HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.

17. Automation is running fine kn chrome but failing on IE . What could be the reason.
During cross browser testing, it is sometimes found that one test script fails in one browser, where it passes in a different browser. What is the reason behind this? Is there any specific reason why this happens, for java- selenium web driver, test scripts?


Ans - It happens due to  element locators postions changes from one web page to other webpage
The crazy thing about Chrome, Firefox and IE is that all three run at different speeds. I've found Chrome to be the fastest, Firefox to be the middle ground and IE to be the slowest. That means I typically have to build in enough explicit waits so they pass for Chrome's speed (otherwise I get elements aren't clickable) but make sure my timeouts are high enough so that my IE test runs don't timeout.
===============================================================================
48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?
Ans-So can you override an overloaded function? Yes, since the overloaded method is a completely different method in the eyes of the compiler.

62. Is it allowed to mark an method in interface as static?
Ans -All methods in an interface are explicitly abstract and hence you cannot define them as static or final because static or final methods cannot be abstract.
===============================================================================
68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for
variables in interfaces?

Ans - All the variables in interface are public static final by default 
===============================================================================
77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Ans Yes, we can declare the main () method as final in Java. The compiler does not throw any error.

If we declare any method as final by placing the final keyword then that method becomes the final method.
The main use of the final method in Java is they are not overridden.
We can not override final methods in subclasses.
==============================================================================
19. Can we inherit a Constructor?

10)If An Exception Raised Inside catch Block Then What Will Happen?
An exception in the catch will basically behave as if there was no catch block there to begin with. You see this pattern in multilayered code where you rethrow exceptions. This is a slight variation on your example, but the result is very similar.

try
{}
catch
{
  throw;
}
In the case above and in your case the exception is considered unhandled since it's still propagating up the stack.

There will be no return value. The program simply fails if there is no other catch block to deal with it.
---Progm will fail , as if there is no catch block--

What is the difference between error and exception in java?
Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running. For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory. Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.

===============================================================================
Q:What is unreachable catch block error?

A block of statements to which the control can never reach under any case can be called as unreachable blocks. Unreachable blocks are not supported by Java. The catch block mentioned with the reference of Exception class should and must be always last catch block because Exception is the superclass of all exceptions. When we are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones.

When you are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most general ones. i.e sub classes of Exception must come first and super classes later. If you keep super classes first and sub classes later, compiler will show unreachable catch block err

Q: Example of method overriding in selenium framework ?

Examples of Method Overriding
In the WebDriver interface, we use two different methods for navigating or accessing any website i.e. driver.get() and driver.navigate().to().

These two methods are examples of Method Overriding.

Enlisted below is the basic difference between the navigate() and get() method and this is frequently asked in Selenium Interviews.

The get() method does not load the web page completely if you are going to do some other operation after loading a page. This is the reason for which get() is faster than navigate().
Using get() method, you can not traverse back and forward whereas Navigate() supports back and forth traversal of a web page using navigate().forward() and navigate().back().

Q:Can abstract class be final in Java?
Ans-No
===============================================================================
Q:Can abstract class contains main method in Java?
Ans-Yes, you can use the main() method in abstract class. The main() method is a static method so it is associated with Class, not with object or instance. The abstract is applicable to the object so there is no problem if it contains the main method.
